Some of the bodies recovered were charred beyond recognition.One of the employees, police said, sustained severe spinal injuries after he jumped down from the fifth floor.Employees, who survived the blaze, said that fire tenders reached the spot at least 90 minutes after the first call was made to the police. Fire department officials, however, rubbished the claims and said they rushed to the spot as soon as they were informed.The fire station is located just two kilometers away from the site of the incident in Sector 2. ?Twelve fire tenders, one 32 meters and another 42 meters hydraulic lift machines reached the spot within 30 minutes of being informed. It took us time to reach the spot because of traffic and encroachment on the road. Our Ghaziabad staff also reached the spot and lent us a helping hand,? said Aman Sharma, a fire department official. Initial estimates suggest that good sworth at least Rs 15 crore was gutted in the fire.Sources also said that the blaze also brought to the fore major lapses with regards to jurisdiction. Employees trapped inside the building said they kept calling 100 to inform Noida police about the incident but their call was diverted to neighbouring Delhi and Ghaziabad. A factory employee, Sheeshpal, said, that the fire broke out around 1pm. ?When we dialed 100, the call connected to Delhi police control room. Later, when we again tried to contact the police, the call connected to Ghaziabad police control room. After several attempts, we finally connected to Noida police control room,? he said. Sheeshpal said 12 employees worked in factory. ?It appears that fire started due to a short circuit on the third floor. We were trapped on the third floor after the blaze started. While four employees rushed upstairs after the blaze, the others rushed downstairs. One employee, Vivek, jumped from the fifth floor to escape the blaze,? said Ashish Kumar, another employee. The condition of Vivek is stated to be critical.?We swung into action as soon as we were informed about the fire. Over a dozen fire tenders were sent to the spot to douse the flames.

Until recently, the civic body was relying on the attendance register. The tough stance is against employees who benefit from administrative leniency and skip work by just signing on the register. Sudhir Naik, deputy municipal commissioner of the general administration department in BMC, confirmed the development. He said, ?Employees won?t get salary if they fail to mark attendance through the biometric system.?

The lines under Phase 4, in addition to the 140 kilometres added in Phase 3, are expected to free up traffic bottlenecks in congested central and southern parts of the city, and help passengers from outer Delhi.Phase 3 of Metro?s expansion is likely to be completed by mid-2017. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has been seeking approval to start Phase 4?s construction for over a year. The new phase will particularly benefit south Delhi as residents will have the option of taking the Metro to go to the airport.After the completion of Phase 4, the Delhi Metro will become the largest Metro system outside China to carry about seven million passengers every day. Right now, it is the 11th largest Metro system. After Phase 3?s completion, we should be fourth or fifth.The DMRC has proposed to build a 20-km corridor between the existing Aerocity and Tughlakabad Metro stations.

Once this line, which is part of Phase 4 of DMRC, is completed, passengers will have different options of going to the airport. From Aerocity, they can take the Airport Line to go to Terminal 3,? said a senior DMRC official.Phase 4 will add to the ridership of the Airport Line. Almost 15 kilometres of this line will be underground because of space constraints. DMRC officials said they hoped the problem of overcrowding would be solved when lines under Phase 3 of the mass transit system?s expansion become operational.In May, the AAP government gave in-principal approval but the Centre returned the file, saying they need to give financial approval.

On February 14, the day Aero India 2017 begins, the IAF will be the proud owner of its very own indigenous all-weather airborne early warning and control system popularly known as the AEW&C. This aerial platform is meant to be a force multiplier that will guide the IAF's fighter aircraft during combat. It will have the capability to detect incoming fighters, cruise missiles and even drones from both Pakistan and China.For Dr. Christopher, Chairman, DRDO it will be a fine day indeed. He was earlier the Programme Director (airborne early warning and control system) and Director, Centre for Air-Borne Systems in the DRDO before being elevated to the topmost post. Speaking exclusively to India Today, he said that his association with the early warning system programme goes back to 1985 when it all started. He also had a narrow escape having flown on the same test aircraft as a flight engineer that crashed in January 1999. 'I flew on that same test aircraft, the previous sortie, the last but one sortie before it crashed,' he told India Today.The indigenous AEW&C system has been developed by Bengaluru based CABS and integrated onto a Brazilian built Embraer-145 aircraft. It is equipped with a 240-degree coverage radar and can detect, identify and classify threats in the surveillance area and also act as a Command and Control Centre to support Air Defence operations.Dr. CP Ramanarayanan, Director General - Aeronautical Systems (Aero) participated in the final trials of the AEW&C. 'I was onboard this flight in Jodhpur and it was so heartening to see all the functional performance requirements were met meticulously,' he says. According to him the users (IAF) observed that this was such a trial they have never undergone. So while the second AEW&C will be handed over to the IAF in a few months time, the third which was initially to be with CABS, will also be handed over to the IAF.LOTS OF CATCHING UP TO DOChina today has more than 20 AWACS and Pakistan has 8 AWACS, India on the other hand has just this one AEW&C and 3 Phalcon systems.

At one point, the farmers even started rolling on the street naked.The farmer who led the naked protest was eventually arrested. Here's why these farmers are protesting:1. Last year, Tamil Nadu recorded the worst spell of northeast monsoon in 140 years, leading to most farmers losing their winter crop. Most of these farmers had lost their summer crop too, due to Tamil Nadu's tussle with Kanataka over sharing water from the Cauvery river.The timing of government's demonetisation move didn't help either, as the prevailing cash crunch prevented farmers from tackling their farming expenses. Most of them couldn't even prepare for the next sowing season.2. The shock over crop loss and lack of revenue led to some farmers getting heart attacks, while many others committed suicide. At one point, an estimated 106 farmer deaths were reported within a month in Tamil Nadu. Some reports also say 144 farmers committed suicide between October to December in 2016.For the remaining farmers, loan installments and dues to moneylenders have now become the greatest problem. Most farmers haven't earned anything to come through on these payments. Farmers who tried selling their land, couldn't even find buyers because it was that dry.3. With no option left, a contingent of these farmers from Thanjavur and Tiruchirappalli came to Delhi and have been protesting at Jantar Mantar since March 14.These farmers seek a drought relief fund of Rs 40,000 crore, better support for their produce and a loan waiver for peasants in Tamil Nadu. One Tamil Nadu local told Firstpost that the farmers asked for a compensation of Rs 25,000 per acre, but they were only paid Rs 5,465 per acre.4. Despite the attention their protests have received, the farmers still await a meeting with the government's top officials. To garner attention, these farmers have resorted to all kinds of methods like cutting themselves and holding dead rats and snakes in their mouth.Late in March some farmers even wore skulls of dead Tamil Nadu farmers, symbolising the fate that awaits them if the centre does not help.Two farmers even attempted suicide at Jantar Mantar.\", \"In the uproar today in Jammu and Kashmir Assembly following the Opposition's protest against the PDP-BJP government, the national anthem was allegedly insulted when the ruckus continued even as it was played.The protesting Opposition members, mainly from the National Conference and the Congress, created ruckus as they tried to disrupt Governor NN Vohra's address to the joint session of the bicameral legislature in Jammu.ALSO READ | How national anthem should be played in cinema halls: Home Ministry is out with an advisoryAs the Governor started his address, members of the Opposition parties stood up shouting slogans against the PDP-BJP government.The Governor rushed to the concluding part of his speech amid the din.\", 'Kolkata, Jul 23 (PTI) Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), the nodal national agency for administering customs and GST, was unhappy with West Bengals introduction of e-way bill system without waiting for it being launched by the Centre across the country. \"West Bengal is one of the two states in the country which has already introduced e-way bill.

His signing completes a transformation of City?s defence since Guardiola?s appointment last summer.City confirmed over the weekend the Â£26.5m switch from Real Madrid of Danilo, who is expected to provide cover for the first-choice full-backs Mendy and the Â£45m signing from Tottenham Hotspur, Kyle Walker. They will line up alongside other expensive arrivals including the centre-back John Stones, signed last season for Â£47m, and the Â£34.9m goalkeeper Ederson from Benfica.The signing of Mendy, in particular, is a statement not only of City?s financial firepower but also of Guardiola?s determination to build the kind of ruthless attacking machine which he developed at Barcelona and Bayern Munich.Mendy, 23, came through Le Havre?s youth system before a move to Marseille in 2013. He switched to Monaco last summer for Â£11m where he established himself as one of the best full-backs in the world with his powerful and direct style of play as the club claimed the French title and reached the Champions League semi-finals.Like Walker, Mendy is at his most effective going forward and City will hope the duo can add a surge of energy in wide areas that was lacking last season; Guardiola received some criticism for switching between four and three at the back and deploying his full-backs in unfamiliar roles tucked into midfield. City?s new recruits indicate a move towards a more typical and consistent four-man defence, although Mendy and Walker are comfortable at wing-back.Mendy will join City?s squad in Los Angeles where Guardiola?s side are preparing to face Real Madrid in the International Champions Cup .?I am absolutely delighted to be joining Manchester City,? Mendy said. ?They are one of Europe?s leading clubs and in Pep Guardiola they have a manager committed to playing attacking football. I am sure that over the next few years we will be successful.?Txiki Begiristain, City?s director of football, said: ?Benjamin has all the qualities we are looking for in a full-back. For such a young player he has a wealth of top-level experience. He is undoubtedly one of the world?s best full-backs, our No1 target in this position. We are all delighted to have him here at Manchester City.?', 'New Delhi, Jun 15 (PTI) Liquor baron Vijay Mallya had allegedly floated 20 shell companies, directors of which were either his personal staff or those who retired, the ED has said in its recent charge sheet filed in the KFA-IDBI money laundering case. The central probe agency, meanwhile, is set to confiscate a coffee estate in Coorg in Karnataka and other assets in Bengaluru which it had attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), as it did with a Rs 100 crore farm house in Maharashtras Alibaug recently. The Enforcement Directorate had registered a criminal case in this deal last year and has attached assets worth over Rs 9,600 crore till now. \"Mallya was holding directly or indirectly movable and immovable assets, in the form of shares of public listed companies, by way of creating a web of shell companies. The assets were being in shell/dummy companies created by Mallya,\" the ED said in its charge sheet filed in Mumbai yesterday. The over 5,000 page charge sheet or prosecution compliant, with 57 pages of the main report and rest annexures, has been filed before a special PMLA court in Mumbai. The charge sheet said Mallya had \"formed a complex web structure of his group companies so as to indirectly control their affairs.\" \"He has nominated directors in those companies who were either his personal staff, retired company official or a third person,\" it said. The agency identified the alleged shell firms as Ms PE Data Centre Resources Private Limited, Ms Pharma Trading Limited, Ms Kingfisher Finvest Limited, Devi Investment Private Limited, Ms Mallya Investment Private Limited, Ms Explicit Consultancy Private Limited, Ms Ambitious Computech Private Limited and Vilora Consultancy Private Limited among others. Shell companies are defined as those firms which are set up by nominal paid-up capital, high reserves and surplus on account of receipt of high share premium, investment in unlisted companies, no dividend income or high cash in hand among others. It added \"there were unencumbered (free of debt) properties more than Rs 1,760.03 crore in addition to the properties mentioned in the personal guarantee submitted by Mallya to the IDBI bank\", indicating that these assets were not pledged as collaterals towards security of the bank loan. Describing how the alleged siphoning off the funds happened in this case, the agency said, \"It is suspected that major portion out of amount of Rs 417.29 crore was remitted out of India to overseas parties from IDBI bank.\" It mentioned a transaction made to a firm which allegedly had fake or dummy directors. \"An amount of Rs 63.10 crore (approximately) was paid to Ms UBICS Technologies Pvt Ltd (controlled by Mallya). Directors are dummy directors acting on behalf of Mallya. \"This company was used as a special purpose vehicle to route the funds of Ms KFA as no other transaction from any other company has been noticed in this,\" it said. \"Thus, the acts of Mallya, Ms UBHL and others, establish that a criminal conspiracy was hatched for obtaining or sanctioning of bank loan to KFA in gross violations of established procedures and the airline had no intention for repayment of loan of Rs 900 crore since beginning. \"The said loan amount along with interest totalling Rs 1,301.67 crore therefore falls within the sweep of the proceeds of crime in terms of section....of the PMLA,\" the charge sheet said. Thus, it said, the accused have been \"actually involved\" with the concealment, possession, acquisition and use of the proceeds of crime and therefore knowingly and intentionally in the activity of money laundering as defined under section 3 of the PMLA and are liable for punishment under section 4 of the PMLA.

The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), has decided to do away with the procedure to speed up the check in process from April 1. Besides Delhi, the rule will be implemented in Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Cochin. In December, CISF had started trial runs for this but stamping was resumed after a week due to security concerns. The BCAS had in February issued an order announcing that the procedure was to be done away with but the CISF had at that time object to immediate implementation of the plan. Following this, a joint meeting was held to iron out issues.  ?Appropriate measures have been taken. The cycle of security check will speed up and our staff will get more time to check suspicious baggage,? CISF DG OP Singh said.Recently, CISF had conducted trial runs in two phases at 12 airports and concluded that stamping of baggage tags could be dispensed with after certain modifications of security architecture in Security Hold Areas of the airports and installation of high definition CCTV cameras. These modifications were required to make sure that passengers could not access bags containing restricted items which are segregated by CISF personnel for checking. ?High Definition CCTV cameras focussed on the baggage screening system were required so that CISF personnel who cleared a bag could be easily identified to fix accountability,? a CISF official said.CISF had collected the feed back during the one-week trial run. ?In Bengaluru, 89% of the passengers appreciated the move, while 11% said that stamp on tag brings a sense of security. In Delhi, over 2,400 flights were covered and in some cases, during random check at boarding gates, few suspicious items were caught. We were required to fill the gap before reintroducing it,? the official added.During the trial run from December 15-22, security check areas were monitored through CCTV cameras to ensure no passenger skips the mandatory check. CISF staff at the boarding gates have been asked not to check for  baggage tag. The decision was taken after the D-G met representatives of all the airlines last week. ?As per the feedback, stamping causes inconvenience to passengers. Many a times, a passenger is turned away from the boarding gate if the tag gets misplaced,? he further said.Often if a traveller is asked to open a bag after it goes through a scan. Others in the queue have to wait till their tags can be stamped. ?Now, if one passenger is stopped, others in the queue can move on to the boarding gate after security check. This will benefit the passengers and at no point, security will be compromised,? he said. ', 'Another day, another attack by the Opposition on demonetisation.

As per government figures tabled in parliament during the budget session, nearly 27,000 children have gone missing in Delhi in the last five years and only 9,700 could be traced.Across the country, 30 per cent of the children remained untraceable, but in Delhi the number is the highest - 63 per cent.INITIATIVES LAUNCHEDÂ\\xa0 Bhagat said police have launched a scheme, \"Pehchaan: Safeguarding the Childhood\", as part of its anti-human trafficking drive.Under the \\'Pehchaan\\' initiative, children belonging to poor families residing in JJ clusters and resettlement colonies are being registered and photographed from time to time with the district police \"so that they can be traced if they happen to go missing in future\", Bhagat said.Bhagat said the \"situation is alarming\" in the capital and \"sometimes it is difficult to trace missing children since poor families do not even have photographs\" of their children.Thus beat constables have been tasked to capture photograph of all kids in slum areas, he said.\"Under the \\'Pehchaan\\' scheme, we also create awareness with the help of NGOs from time to time about crime rates with minors and juvenile in the capital.

The world-famous university had applied to the High Court in London to dismiss the claim by Faiz Siddiqui but in an 18-page judgement by Justice Kerr last week the court ruled that Oxford does have a case to answer, The Sunday Times reported. Siddiqui, who studied modern history at Brasenose College at the university, accuses its staff of \"negligent\" teaching of his specialist subject course on Indian imperial history, which led to him getting a 2:1 back in 2000. The 38-year-olds barristerÂ\\xa0Roger Mallalieu had told the court that the problem came down to four of the seven staff teaching Asian history being on sabbatical leave at the same time during the 1999-2000 academic year. SiddiquiÂ\\xa0believes he could have had a high-flying career as an international commercial lawyer if he had not got lower grades and decided to take the legal route, which came to light last month. His legal team had singled out the \"boring\" standard of tuition thatÂ\\xa0SiddiquiÂ\\xa0had received from David Washbrook, an expert on the history of southern India between the 18th and 20th centuries. Mallalieu claimed that the eminent historian?s teaching had suffered from the \"intolerable\" pressure of the staff shortages on the course. \"There is no personal criticism of Dr Washbrook. Our target is on the university?s back for allowing this to happen,\" Mallalieu told the court. Siddiqui, who trained as a solicitor after college, suffers from depression and insomnia, which he links to his \"disappointing examination results\".

The film has rubbed the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) the wrong way, as a result of which, it might land in a legal mess.Rangoon, directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, is playing in theatres without a censor certificate and the anti-tobacco short films. As a result, the CBFC is mighty miffed with the makers of Rangoon. While on the one hand, Rangoon any which way, hasn\\'t been getting any love at the ticket windows, this will end up adding to the plethora of problems the film is battling.Pahlaj Nihalani, the chairperson of the CBFC, told DNA, \"It has been brought to our notice that Rangoon has been playing in theatres across the country and outside India without the censor certificate and without the anti-smoking short films, which are compulsory for all films that show actors smoking and/or drinking. Rangoon had many scenes showing the main leads indulging in serious substance abuse. We asked the makers to put a disclaimer ahead of the opening credits. That disclaimer has gone missing. Now, we have been informed that the anti-smoking films do not play at the beginning and after the intermission. And also that the censor certificate is not flashed at the start, as per law. These are serious offences.\"The film, which is a love story set against the backdrop of the World War II, stars Saif Ali Khan as film producer Rusi Bilimoria, Kangana Ranaut as the fiesty Miss Julia (a character based on Fearless Nadia), and Shahid Kapoor as Jamadar Nawab Malik of the British Indian Army.Rangoon, said Nihalani, has flouted several rules set by the CBFC.

We would not like to point fingers at anyone else for the lapse at this time. It is the digital operators\\' responsibility to play exactly the length that is shown to us and certified by the CBFC. Not a second more or less of footage must be shown in theatres than what we have certified. The exact length of the film that is shown to us and certified by us is mentioned in the censor certificate. If the anti-smoking films have been removed from the beginning and after intermission and if the censor certificate is not being shown in Rangoon, then, the digital operators are screening less footage than what has been approved by the CBFC. It is a serious offence. We are investigating to see how deep the offence goes,\" said Nihalani.The CBFC head went on to add, \"Maybe some self-appointed intellectuals of our film industry feel it is okay to break the law as long as they can ridicule the jurisdiction of the CBFC.\" Rangoon\\'s laidback pace and lack of a coherent storyline has been pointed out as reasons behind its worrisome performance at the box office in India.

Digital payments in India would jump nearly 10 times to $500 billion by 2020, according to a 2016 report by Boston Consulting Group.WhatsApp itself has been looking at moving into digital payment services in India.The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday was first to report Paytm?s plan to launch a messaging service. Paytm did not respond to an email seeking comment while WhatsApp was not immediately reachable for comment.', 'Bihar\\'s minister for excise and prohibition Abdul Jalil Mastan has kicked up a controversy after his video abusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and calling him a \"dacoit\" went viral. In the video, the minister allegedly asked the crowd to beat the photograph of the Prime Minister with slippers.The video was shot on February 22 when Mastan, a Congress leader, was addressing a Jan Vedna rally against demonetisation in his constituency of Amour in Purnia district.As the BJP leaders protested in the Assembly demanding the minister\\'s expulsion from the cabinet, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar condemned the remarks and called them wrong.Senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister of Bihar Sushil Modi said \"regret by CM Nitish is not enough and Mastan should be sacked from the cabinet\".Mastan, in the eye of a major political storm, apologised for his remarks. \"I apologise if my statements have hurt anyone,\" the minister said.

Between 2012 and 2017 alone, 523 cases of wetland destruction were reported, a report compiled by the Mumbai-based NGO Vanashakti revealed at the National Mangrove Conference in Dona Paula, Goa, on Thursday. Ten major cases were reported from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, but the most cases were reported in Thane, at Kalher, Kasheli and Dombivli among other areas. In Mumbai, the destruction is taking place right under our noses ? a 400-acre patch opposite Millat Nagar in Oshiwara-Lonkhandwala, a 15-acre patch at Shivaji Nagar, a 200 acre patch in Charkop and a 10-acre patch in Dahisar.Why does this matter to you? Wetlands are areas of land covered by water, and apart from being home to several species of plants and animals, they act as a carbon sink by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and cleaning the air you breathe.READ: Maharashtra government order to save wetlands: List those larger than 2.25ha by September?More than 500 wetland destruction cases were reported in five years. This couldn?t have been possible if not for active support from government machinery such as police and revenue department,? said Stalin D, director, NGO Vanashakti. ?The state mangrove cell, meanwhile, has managed to keep the wetlands under their control, relatively safe.?In 2014, the Bombay HC banned reclamation and construction on wetlands after Vanashakti filed a PIL to protect them. Stalin said even during the wetland grievance redressal committee meetings (formed by the state as per HC directions), corporations and revenue departments refused to restore degraded wetlands citing poor funds and lack of places to dump debris from wetlands. ?Despite several court orders, municipal corporations in Mumbai, Thane, Mira Bhayander and Vasai are ignorant about conserving wetlands,? Stalin said. According to the national wetland atlas developed by the Union environment ministry, Maharashtra (spread across 3.07 lakh sqkm) has a wetland cover of just 10,145 sqkm . The Vanashakti data comes a week after HT reported the state had directed every district to document wetlands larger than 2.25 hectares by September, to protect them. Before this directive, the state mapped 320 wetlands in forest areas across 25 districts . Beefing up security and tightening laws were the only ways to protect wetlands, experts said. ?Wetland destruction is a much larger violation than just destroying mangroves, which are a part of wetlands. The state needs to levy stricter fines and soon,? said Arvind Untawale, executive secretary of the Mangrove Society of India. ?The Vanashakti report is an eye-opener to the massive loss already incurred by the state.?Konkan commissioner Jagdish Patil told HT, ?We are drafting an action plan to protect these sites better.

It was very animated and very friendly. Putin?s translator was translating. I found out about it because people were startled.?There was no one else within earshot, Bremmer added, and it is not known what the men discussed. Trump was not joined in the conversation by his own translator, which is thought to be a breach of national security protocol. The White House later said that the translator who accompanied Trump spoke Japanese, not Russian, and that was why Trump and Putin spoke through the Russian translator.Bremmer added: ?It?s very clear that Trump?s best single relationship in the G20 is with Putin. US allies were surprised, flummoxed, disheartened. You?ve got Trump in the room with all these allies and who?s the one he spends time with??Such was the level of concern that someone decided to bring it to Bremmer?s attention. He said he had expected the White House to go public. ?I sat on this for days hoping they would talk about it. I knew last week. It didn?t happen. I?m an analyst; I?m not in the business of breaking news,? he said.There is no official government record of the meeting and it was not previously disclosed by the White House, which is facing investigations into the Trump campaign?s Russia ties by the special counsel Robert Mueller and two congressional committees.?During the course of the dinner, all the leaders circulated throughout the room and spoke with one another freely,? a senior administration official said in a statement Tuesday night, adding: ?There was no ?second meeting? between President Trump and President Putin, just a brief conversation at the end of a dinner. The insinuation that the White House has tried to ?hide? a second meeting is false, malicious and absurd. It is not merely perfectly normal, it is part of a president?s duties, to interact with world leaders.?Also on Tuesday night, the president tweeted to say the news coverage of the ?secret dinner with Putin is ?sick??, insisting twice that the press was aware of the dinner. While it is true that the dinner was well known and covered by the news media, the press at large did not know about the private conversation between Putin and Trump. Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is \"sick.\" All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!Trump?s presidency has been overshadowed by allegations that his election campaign colluded with Russia. Last week it emerged that his son, Donald Trump Jr, held a meeting with a Russian lawyer and Russian American political operative with a view to receiving allegedly incriminating information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Trump Jr claims it led nowhere and denies wrongdoing.Trump has consistently and mysteriously refused to criticise the Russian leader. Bremmer said: ?I?ve never in my life seen a relationship between two major countries where the interests are so misaligned while the leaders are so buddy-buddy. It doesn?t add up.?Trump has been inconsistent on his China policy, he?s been inconsistent on his Nato policy. On any foreign policy issue he?s been on both sides. Except Russia. It doesn?t make sense. The fact he was willing to do this in front of global leaders shows he just doesn?t care how America is perceived.?The first meeting was scheduled to last 30 minutes but went on for more than two hours. During a flight on Air Force One last week, the US president said he raised the issue of election meddling twice and Putin denied it. ?I said, look, we can?t ? we can?t have ? now, he said ?absolutely not? twice.

Officials said that the move is aimed at improving civic amenities in villages. For kicking off the initiative, the authority has decided to name lanes of Jhundpura village.?We are completing the necessary formalities to start the process of naming lanes in Jhundpura. We have not yet finalised a date for starting the work but it will be soon,? Rakesh Kumar Mishra, an additional chief executive officer of the Noida authority, said.There are 82 villages in Noida. The city is developed on 20,000 hectares acquired from farmers of these villages. These urban villages are located adjacent to upscale residential sectors but are yet to have basic civic amenities such as drainage, sewage network and roads, among others.?We are working on preparing a robust municipal policy to ensure the development of civic facilities in villages on a par with urban areas. We cannot ignore the villages because all areas are interconnected,? said Mishra. Poor civic amenities in villages affect urban areas as well, officials said. For example, choking of drains in villages on Thursday and subsequent waterlogging after Thursday?s downpour was a result of lack of municipal services in villages, officials said.?Migrant workers and daily wagers cannot afford to live in sectors because of high rental costs. They have to live in villages. The population of villages is rising every day. In the absence of civic amenities in villages, residents dump their waste in the drains, leading to waterlogging. It has to be stopped immediately if Noida officials want to address civic issues in villages,? said Raghuraj Singh, a Congress leader and resident of Bishanpura, near Sector 58, Noida. Villagers have been demanding a unique address (land title) for many years as it will give their properties a legal status and enable them to get loans, on a par with flat or plot owners. ?Our demand for a clear land title is yet to be addressed,? said Singh.?As of now, we will only name the lanes and address civic issues. We will look into other demands of villagers later,? said Mishra.The authority in January 2016 had started a drive to name lanes of Bishanpura and provide adequate facilities but if fizzled out.', 'The Congress legislators from Gujarat staying at a resort outside Bengaluru are willing to return home if state chief minister Vijay Rupani promises their safety, party spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said on Sunday.The party shepherded 44 lawmakers on Friday night to the holiday retreat in Karnakata after a spate of resignation of its MLAs amid allegations that the ruling BJP in Gujarat were bribing and coercing them ahead of the August 5 vice-presidential election.?We have been threatened, offered money to defect and some have done so,?

It is like a thief attacking a cop. If their leaders are leaving them, it has nothing to do with us,? he said.The Congress responded that its MLAs have not abandoned their constituencies, but were compelled by the BJP to move out.?There is an attempt by the BJP to steal our legislators. But we will fight to save democracy,?

For me that was exciting.\"Everybody was having fun, everyone was trying to support their team mates.\"Bolt\\'s appearance helped secure a clutch of big names for the event, with American former Olympic 400m hurdles champion Kerron Clement running in his All-Stars team who won the overall event ahead of Australia.Christine Ohuruogu, the 2008 Olympic 400m champion, captained Team England.With mixed team events, a 2x300m relay and an elimination mile in which runners were knocked out progressively, the meeting carried on with troupes of dancers gyrating to electronic music in front of an enthusiastic crowd of about 7,000.SIMILAR SPECTACLEIt was a spectacle similar to any of the \\'Big Bash\\' Twenty20 matches played at the nearby Melbourne Cricket Ground.But whereas Twenty20 competitions are underpinned by the support of dozens of high-profile players, Bolt carries a lot of the burden on his own shoulders.\"It\\'s not an understatement to say that we wouldn\\'t be here today if it wasn\\'t for Usain Bolt and his management,\" Athletics Australia president Mark Arbib told Reuters before the meeting.\"Usain Bolt and (agent) Ricky Simms have not just put their name to it, and are not just taking part, they have taken a stake in the business itself.\"They\\'ve promoted it, selected the Bolt All-Star team, they\\'ve put their own IP (intellectual property) into the All-Stars, they\\'re building a significant commercial asset.\"Like a number of federations across the globe, Athletics Australia has battled to arrest declining crowds and interest in the sport, initially conceiving of the series as helping to boost the low profile of the nation\\'s top athletes.But Bolt\\'s signature had proven a \"game-changer\", Arbib, a former federal sports minister, said.It had secured a prime-time broadcast for a local athletics meeting for the first time in nearly a decade while attracting key corporate backers.Among them, Kerry Stokes, owner of the series\\' host broadcaster Seven West Media, had invested A$1 million ($768,000) of his own funds, the Australian Financial Review newspaper reported.The crowd was lower than the 8,500 stadium capacity but total tickets sold over the three nights of the series had comfortably outstripped those sold for the entire programme of national athletics events last year.If ambition was an Olympic sport, organisers could already crown themselves gold medal winners.', \"As Goa heading for assembly poll on February 4 the political parties aping the ante ahead for crucial assembly poll on the state.

In the other stood a lanky Justin Trudeau, the underdog whom bookies were giving 3-1 odds against.That 2012 boxing match marked a pivotal moment in Trudeau?s political career. But his account of the episode is now raising eyebrows, after he offered a glimpse into his decision to take on indigenous politician Patrick Brazeau.?It wasn?t random,? Trudeau told Rolling Stone magazine in an interview published this week. ?I wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy tough-guy senator from an indigenous community. He fit the bill, and it was a very nice counterpoint. I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.?The comments ? part of a 6,800-word August cover story on the prime minister ? sparked immediate reaction. ?So ?privileged white guy beats up Indian? was the ?right kind of narrative?? Seriously?? wrote one person on Twitter, while another noted: ?White guy in power & entitlement looks 4 an #Indigenous human to beat up so he looks like a strong white dude. How precious & colonial supreme.?Others pointed to Trudeau?s much vaunted commitments to diversity and tackling the deep-rooted inequities facing many indigenous peoples in Canada. ?What is up @JustinTrudeau after all your talk of inclusion you brag about beating up a guy with the issues you swore to address,? tweeted one. Another said: ?Trudeau literally using indigenous people as political props.? The encounter came to a halt in the third round as Trudeau pummelled Brazeau in a corner, but it marked the beginning of Trudeau?s rise to Canada?s top office. Brazeau ? who told reporters after the match that it was his ego, not his reddened nose, that was most hurt ? would later be cast out of the Conservative caucus following a 2013 arrest for sexual assault and domestic abuse.As Trudeau?s description of planning the boxing match made the rounds online, some questioned how it squared with Trudeau?s promise to repair the country?s relationship with the more than 1.4 million indigenous peoples ? many of whom grapple with rates of poverty, incarceration and suicide that are much higher than non-indigenous Canadians.Many continue to reel from the effects of Canada?s church-run residential school system ? described by last year?s truth commission as a tool of cultural genocide ? while systemic inequalities have left some living in inadequate, overcrowded housing with undrinkable water.Algonquin artist Jay Odjick pointed to Trudeau?s comments as a possible explanation for the slow pace of reconciliation. ?Canada, your leader went to US media today saying that when he needed a villain to fit his narrative, an indigenous person was a good fit,? he wrote on Twitter. ?The sad fact is, WE are the only people he could get away with in terms of this. Think about perception if he had chosen another PoC person.? On Thursday, Trudeau?s office pointed to the launch of a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous girls and women as well as government promises for investment in education, infrastructure and healthcare to highlight the prime minister?s commitment to Indigenous issues. ?He has made it clear that there is no relationship more important to him ? and to our government ? than reconciliation with Indigenous peoples,? a spokesperson for Trudeau said in a statement to the Guardian. ?We are fully committed to a renewed nation-to-nation relationship and to reconciliation.?The Rolling Stone interview ? promoted on the magazine with the question ?Why can?t he be our president?? ? prompted intense debate in Canada. Many lauded the profile, which included phrases such as ?For Trudeau, listening is seducing? and sought to contrast Trudeau with Donald Trump. Polls suggest Trudeau?s approval rating among Canadians remains high, at around 53%, 20 months after his government took power. But others reacted with skepticism, pointing to Trudeau?s broken promises on electoral reform and deficit spending as well as his government?s sluggish response in addressing indigenous issues.?This yearning for an anti-Trump to call their own means the US media are glossing over or ignoring the troubling similarities between both leaders, not the least of which is an obsession with celebrity that is ultimately counterproductive to governance,? wrote Toronto Star columnist Vinay Menon. ?The attention might be nice. But a bit more neighbourly honesty would be even better.?', 'Pakistan International Airlines will suspend flight between Mumbai and Karachi from May 15.

This is in violation of the sanctioned plans and maps approved by the department of town and country planning. However, insiders say that the developers are ready to take the risk as there is no other way for them to avoid the ban. The excise department, meanwhile, said the process to measure the motorable distance of the bars and pubs will begin on Wednesday. At the Ambience Mall, the developer has closed the entrance to the Leela Ambience Hotel and visitors will now have to drive around the residential complex before entering the hotel. This has also hit the entry to the Ambience Lagoon apartments and invited the ire  of the residents. ?We have complained to the police and DTCP officials but nothing has been done. Fast moving luxury cars and commercial traffic is now moving in front of our complex. Children and elders can?t go out on the road,? said Sanjay Lal, member of the RWA executive committee. Liquor sales at bars and pubs in Cyber Hub and Ambience mall are major crowd pullers and generate huge revenue for these properties. The bar/pub owners in Sector 29 also want HUDA to block entry to one of the roads so that the motorable distance can be increased. ?We have invested crores in setting up these facilities. The government should now help us,? said a bar owner, preferring anonymity. Similarly, the entrance to Cyber Hub near Rapid Metro station next to Shankar Chowk has been moved to ensure that the motorable distance is more than a kilometre from NH8. More than 150 bars and pubs in Gurgaon have been hit by the Supreme Court?s ban on liquor sale within 500 metres of state and national highways. HC Dahiya, excise commissioner, west Gurgaon, said that the motorable distance from the edge of the road will be the criteria for renewal of licences.

The protest was sparked by an incident last week when the relatives of a deceased patient beat up a resident doctor at Mumbai\\'s Sion Hospital.Addressing the issue behind the agitation, Mahajan said, \"The government will provide 500 guards too civic-run hospitals within five days, 600 guards within 20 days and 1,100 guards within a month.\" Â\\xa0Earlier today, the Birhanmumbai Municipal Corporation issued a notice on the matter, asking 500 resident doctors in Mumbai to resume work or face disciplinary action.

', 'Actor Taapsee Pannu has made her name in Bollywood with hard-hitting roles in Pink (2016) and Naam Shabana, but it was quite different in her debut film, Jhummandi Naadam (2010), directed by K. Raghavendra Rao, a legend of Telugu cinema.The actor has been roundly bashed on social media for referring to Rao?s penchant for ?showing [the heroine?s] midriff and throwing fruits and flowers at it?, in a chat with the comedy group East India Comedy. This was said as part of Taapsee?s anecdote about her first film, but this got angry fan reactions like ?ungrateful?, a ?hypocrite? and a ?backstabber? for supposedly forgetting her roots and taking a dig at such a veteran.Talking to Hindustan Times, Taapsee says, ?Er, what did I take a dig at? He?s known for that. I have stated a fact, and if you?re taking it in a derogatory manner, that?s your problem.? She says, ?Trust me, him or me, both of us are really unperturbed by whatever I have said, because I?ve seen the video and he has seen it, too, along with his family, and we are all laughing at it.?Maintaining that she didn?t say anything ?disrespectful? about anyone, Taapsee quips that the only person she ?disrespected or made fun of? in the entire chat video was herself. In it, she had said, ?...When my turn came, maybe because my midriff wasn?t quite ready, they threw a coconut on me! I don?t know what is so sensuous about a coconut hitting my midriff!?She tells us, ?And I still stand by all of that. Whatever I mentioned there was not to make fun of anyone expect me, and it was purely on the basis of facts. I didn?t say anything derogatory or disrespectful to anyone. If people are just going to sit there and wait [for a chance] to get hurt, so they can start throwing shit around at other people, you can never stop them.?Taapsee, who is doing a Telugu film (titled Anando Brahma) after several years, adds that as soon as the negative reactions surfaced, she made it a point to clear the air with K. Raghavendra Rao. ?The only person I was concerned about was my director and his family, and I got [a] good response from them ? they told me that they all sat together and saw the video, and laughed at it, and I guess that?s all that matters,? she says.She might have more to say on this subject, but Taapsee is biding her time. ?Until now, I haven?t really gone out and commented on it, and there?s a reason I?m waiting for the point [when] everyone will hear what I have to say, rather than me saying the same thing ten times to ten different people,? the actor says. ?Right now, I?m just sitting back and seeing how people can have so much of hatred in them that they really want to make so much of negativity out of nothing.?Follow @htshowbiz for more', \"Team India cricketers are apparently not very happy with Anil Kumble and they have complained to the Committee of Administrators (CoA) about the coach's overbearing attitude. Sources told India Today that the players are unhappy with the fact that there was no freedom in the dressing room and insisted that the coach does enjoy cordial relations with the players. It appears Kumble does not enjoy the confidence of his players.WATCH FULL VIDEOThis is a startling development ahead of India's Champions Trophy defense which commences on June 4 at Edgbaston with clash against arch-rivals Pakistan.Kumble was appointed coach for a one-year term by the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) comprising his former teammates Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman in 2016.The former leg-spinner took over and oversaw five successive series triumphs besides limited-overs series victories over New Zealand and England.Under Kumble's watch, India were nearly unbeatable in the home Test season - losing only one of 13, winning 10 and drawing two. However, the BCCI initiated a hunt for a new coach and many felt it was because the board was unhappy with his role in salary negotiations for the players with the CoA.Since it is a volatile situation, the CoA is understood to play it carefully, especially as India are days away from the Champions Trophy.Back in 2007, Australian Greg Chappell's tenure as India coach had come to an end following a public spat with Ganguly and complaints from several other senior cricketers. In the decade that followed, the likes of Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh have spoken out about the tough times the team endured under Chappell.Unlike Chappell, however, Kumble, has delivered the results. Under his command, India have not lost any series and Chesteshwar Pujara, who was going through a slump midway into 2016, finished the last season as the most prolific of Test batsmen.The BCCI, in a press release issued on May 25, merely stated that a nominee of the CoA would oversee the process of appointing the next coach to ensure transparency.\", 'What Mother Teresa is to Calcutta\\'s dying destitutes, Dr Murugappa Chennaveerappa Modi, 72. is to the poor blind villagers of Karnataka. For 45 years. Modi, the internationally recognised eye surgeon, has been waging a one-man war against blindness. In 1986, his name appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records for performing 833 eye operations in a day, the highest in the world. The operations were conducted in Tirupati in 1968 over 14 continuous hours. Modi. Kannukota anna (the brother who gives vision) to the local people, has performed as many as 5.79 lakh eye operations so far. And his labour has always been free.For Modi, his mission is spiritual. \"I see myself as a poojary. The patient is my god, every village is my place of pilgrimage, the operating table is my shrine and my instruments are the accessories of worship,\" says the sprightly surgeon who lives a spartan existence. Born of humble parentage - a Kannadiga from Bijapur district - Modi threw away a lucrative career in private practice after attending Gandhiji\\'s historic prayer meeting at Bombay on August 8, 1942 where the Quit India resolution was passed. That meeting changed his life. And Modi, the gifted ophthalmologist, dedicated his life to the sightless.\"I felt affected when I saw blind people begging. They just did not have money to go to doctors.\" Modi recalled.And those who had the money had often sold their jewellery or livestock to put it together for the treatment. This tragic fact of rural India spurred Modi to pioneer the concept of mass eye camps.In an assembly line fashion, Modi operates 40 patients an hour, attending to four patients at a time. Ambidextrous, he performs delicate eye surgeries with his left hand. He does cataract operations, squint corrections and cornea transplants. Earlier, Modi used to perform 600 to 700 operations a day in his camps. But now in Karnataka, he operates on 200 to 300 patients every day.His phenomenal contributions for the sightless have not gone unappreciated. Recognition has come to him through the Padma Shree and Padma Bhushan. Hellen Keller, the blind and deaf-mute American author, who attended one of his camps in 1954 asked Modi: \"Have you insured your hands?\" In his mass eye camps, apart from the 5.79 lakh operations, he has examined 50 lakh patients and given free food to over 100 lakh persons.Initially Modi had a hard time communicating his mission to the people. \"Villagers used to ask me if I was that good, why was I operating for tree? Modi reminisced.

However, the project fell through.', 'Pakistan?s opposition leader, Imran Khan, has called for a future of ?real democracy? in the country, following the dismissal of Nawaz Sharif as prime minister over corruption charges.?We are thankful to the judiciary because with their judgment, they brought us a new hope,? Khan told a gathering of thousands of supporters on Sunday.The rally in Islamabad was a triumphant celebration for the heartthrob-cricketer-turned-populist-politician, who, since last year, has led a campaign to oust Sharif.Friday?s ruling by Pakistan?s highest court disrupted what had otherwise looked like a smooth path to next year?s election for Sharif?s PML-N party.Former oil minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi will most likely be approved as interim prime minister on Tuesday, at a special session in the 342-member parliament, where the ruling PML-N party holds a strong majority.Abbasi will hold the position for less than two months, until Shahbaz Sharif, younger brother of the ousted prime minister, is confirmed in parliament and can take over.Thousands of supporters from Khan?s Pakistan Tehreek-e Insaf (PTI) party congregated at Islamabad?s parade ground on Sunday for what had been termed a ?thanksgiving day?, the latest of Khan?s signature rallies that have helped him drum up popular support.In front of flag-flying party cadres dressed in the red and green colours of PTI, among towers of loudspeakers blasting music, Khan likened Pakistan?s rulers to ?mafia who safeguard personal interests at any cost?.?When we decided to move against Nawaz in the Panama case, everyone said it was a mistake because in the past, the powerful and mighty ones have been protected. But today I salute the court for giving hope to people for a new Pakistan,? he said.Since his political ascension in 2011, after 15 years in politics, Khan has drawn support particularly from educated urbanites disillusioned with their political elites.?Imran Khan is fighting hard to let people know their political rights and their role in society. He has been a true example,? said Syed Ishfaq, face painted red and green, who had travelled to the capital from Peshawar to participate in the celebration. Last year, Khan received a timely boost with the leak of the so-called Panama Papers, giving credence to his attacks against the political establishment, whom he has called ?the coalition of the corrupt?.After the leak, Khan filed a constitutional petition to have the supreme court investigate the purchase of high-end London property through offshore companies in the name of Sharif?s children, then minors.He organised street protests and demanded a ?lockdown? of Islamabad until the country?s highest court ordered an inquiry into the PM.Sharif, though, was not dismissed for actual corruption but for being deemed dishonest, according to the constitution?s article 62, over unreported income of about Â£2,000 from a Dubai-based company owned by his son. Sharif claims he never received the salary.However, he has not completely dodged a corruption verdict. In its ruling, the supreme court ordered a criminal investigation by an accountability court into the Sharif family based on materials from the Panama Papers.The ouster of Sharif has highlighted the decades-long fractious relationship between the now ex-prime minister and the military. There has been speculation that the court, with its verdict, simply did the military?s bidding, and that Khan was a handy tool for the generals to cut down a prime minister with whom they have feuded for decades. Khan?s supporters dismissed that idea.?If Imran Khan was really a puppet of the military, he would have become prime minister,? said Ishfaq, referring to a claim by Khan that former army chief Pervez Musharraf offered him the position.Friday?s court decision sparked hope among demonstrators that the country?s corrupt leaders can be held accountable. However, the appointment of Nawaz?s younger brother as new prime minister does little to accommodate equally forceful complaints that the Sharif family holds a dynastic grip on power. ?This is is not a democracy but monarchy. It is not a meritocracy. And that is why Pakistan has been left behind developed nations,? Khan said from the stage.Razmat Khan, a supporter, agreed: ?Shahbaz is the same as Nawaz. They just want to keep power in the family.?Supporters of Sharif point out that during his tenure, the economy has grown and security has improved markedly. According to the government, growth reached 5.28% last year. The number of civilians killed in terrorist attacks has dropped from about 3,000 in 2013, when Sharif came into office, to 612 in 2016.?I would give a bit of credit to Nawaz Sharif,? said Ishfaq. ?But it is the law enforcement agencies that have brought peace.?Yet, the improvements are tenuous. Violence has recently resurged in a string of attacks by the Pakistan Taliban and Islamic State, which constitutes a moderate but growing threat in Pakistan. Economic growth is held up by a swelling account deficit, and an overvalued currency is hampering exports. Growth has also not seeped down to the lower classes who make up the majority of the nation of more than 200 million people.?Thousands are jobless. There is no unemployment plan, and no economic policy except securing kickbacks,? said Sheraz Hassan, who drove his three children on a motorbike to the gathering.Many of the celebrating Khan supporters hoped that Pakistan had turned a page. ?The prime minister of Pakistan has been brought to justice,? said Ishfaq. ?That is very rare.?', 'Former Aam Aadmi Party leader and a close aide of party?s national convener Arvind Kejriwal, Mayank Gandhi has slammed the Delhi CM in an open letter on Wednesday as the BJP looked set to complete hat-trick of its rule in the three MCDs.The results of the MCD elections were announced on Wednesday with the AAP facing a rout. The letter, which Gandhi had posted on his blog and tweeted from his handle, addresses Kejriwal ? the Hero and the Politician. Gandhi described the AAP rout as a ?body blow to arrogance?.?Arvind, the unselfish hero who would never compromise, was dead. In his place was a politician who wanted to manipulate that support to fuel his ambition to become a PM in 2019,? Gandhi wrote, referring to direction AAP took after the unprecedented win in the 2015 assembly elections.?We have out beaten other parties with our arrogance and internal politicking,? Gandhi wrote.?You took complete power by becoming convener as well as CM of Delhi. How much more power do you want before you start delivering alternative politics?,? the former AAP leader wrote. ?Abandon the agenda of wanting to be another BJP and Cong. We had come to fight them not become another version of them,? Gandhi said.He advised Kejriwal to give up national ambitions and focus on Delhi. ?For now, forget your national ambitions and focus on governing Delhi well, that is your only chance of staying relevant. Stop dramas and blaming.?Here?s the full letter:Dear Arvind,A defeat deals a body blow to arrogance and makes the mind ready to reflect. So, the timing is appropriate.I am addressing you as your former friend and colleague who believes that AAP can still be salvaged and become the party for alternative politics. I am reaching out to you because my agony is not just mine; but of lakhs of volunteers, donors and supporters.We have known each other since 2003, when I was part of Annaji fast-to-death in Mumbai for the RTI etc. You have been my hero first, friend next and politician later.Let me address the hero firstI remember how you convinced me to get out of my spiritual pursuit and lead the IAC movement in Maharashtra when we met in Nov 2011 in a conference hosted by Bhagwanji Raiyani in SP Jain Institute, Mumbai. In spite of my reluctance, you announced my name. I respected you too much to decline.I remember in mid 2012, when we both were travelling in an auto in Aarey Colony that you told me to quit my job so that I could give full time to the Anna andolan. In spite of my precarious financial situation, I quit my job.I remember we used to discuss idealism in politics till late in the night whenever you stayed with us. My daughter, who was part of those discussions, got inspired to become an IRS like you. So, not just me, my entire family believed in your ideals.I remember that you sent Manish Sisodia to study the experiment that we, in Mumbai, were working on for a citizen consensus candidate for Juhu in 2009. We both were working on creating a model where political candidates could be elected without using money, muscle or divisive agenda i.e. without use of caste, communal, criminal or corrupt practices.That was exactly what AAP attempted in the 2013 and 2015 Delhi elections, successfully.I remember how we used to speak for hours about how the personality or high command driven politics of India was destroying the nation? be it Cong or the BJP or the Thackerays or the Laloo, Mayavati and Mulayam. You hated that, then!When I announced from the stage that you will remove the tubes if you were force fed during your Jantar Mantar fast, there were tears in my eyes along with many others in the audience. When I came to meet you in Delhi during your fast for electricity your health and determination completely shook me up. You refused to compromise. You would rather break than bend. Millions like me admired you and were willing to even give up their lives for you. You were our hero. Where is that Arvind?Like Anna, you were a symbol of the aspirations of an awakened nation. A symbol of the principles of Participation, Accountability, Transparency, Decentralization and Integrity. A symbol of the anger we all felt against the other parties that worked with the 4C (corruption, communalism, criminalization and casteism). AAP became a symbol of the fight of crores of our countrymen against the corrupt parties.In 2014 you resigned as CM of Delhi hoping that there would be immediate re-election and that AAP would sweep back to power on the back of 49 days of good, intense work. But BJP and Cong delayed the election and Modi swept to power in Parliament. To the worry of myself, Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Prithvi, Admiral Ramdas and others ? you started pushing all senior members to agree to form government with the Congress. We refused. You were really furious with us. You were still my hero, but by now I was getting worried with the way you were operating.Then the 2015 Delhi elections were announced. While you had around 5000 volunteers from Delhi working part-time with the candidates; I was part of the leadership of over 6000 volunteers from all over the country, campaigning full time for more than a month. The silent volunteers, the trusting donors, ardent supporters, tele-callers from Rural India to Global Indians contributed and even Yogendra Yadav who was our Chief Spokesperson contributed for AAP victory. What looked like a possible 15-20 seats to AAP suddenly became 67 seats.This is when you made THE classic mistake. You took the complete credit and felt that the support of the nation was for Arvind Kejriwal, the person. You assumed that you were the pied piper whom people were following, but in fact it was the music of a new political culture that had people enchanted.Arvind, the unselfish hero who would never compromise, was dead. In his place was a politician who wanted to manipulate that support to fuel his ambition to become a PM in 2019. You and your coterie decided1. You will be CM but not take any portfolio and focus outside Delhi trying to create a mahagatbandhan to challenge the PM, with you as the face.2. Use the MLAs and senior functionaries outside Delhi to try and win more states. The lack of governance in Delhi due to this fallout was to be blamed on the LG and Central Government.3. Erase the difference between private and public money. Use public money for personal advertising, personal expenditure, fly First class, fight personal cases and whenever this gets questioned ? point fingers at other parties.4. Win at any cost! If Swaraj comes in the way ? throw it away. If appeasement works ? do it. If caste politics gets you the votes ? embrace it. If too many questions are asked ? remove the donation list. If money is required, sell seats. Power is more important than principles.5. Project Kejriwal as a strong leader. Personally attack Modi at every instance so that you would appear like a daring contestant and be able to create a vote bank of anti-Modi votes.6. To further look like a strong leader, remove anyone and everyone from the party that has a differing point of view. As Ashutosh told me ? there should be one voice only in the party and anyone opposing should be dealt in a manner that would give a message that this party deals summarily with anyone who opposes the supremo.As a part of the above strategy, you began by removing Yogendra and Prashant from the party with the worst possible humiliation.When I was told that there was a gag order on informing the volunteers outside, I asked myself, ?What would the real Arvind Kejriwal have done?? He would have listened to his conscience. So I did. I had to inform the lakhs of AAP volunteers about what happened in that crucial meeting, in spite of the gag order. I had the courage of conviction and was ready to be removed from the party. For me, Truth was non-negotiable.You took time to remove me. And in spite of repeated requests to not punish the superb Maharashtra team to spite me, you threw out the entire Maharashtra AAP committees down to the lowest rung in Oct 2015. Can Modi or Sonia remove an entire State team with just an edict? We have out beaten other parties with our arrogance and internal politicking. The other day, a young volunteer with tears in his eyes from rural Maharashtra asked me, ?What is our fault?? What do I tell him, Arvind? Why was he removed?Personally, I have closely seen my friend, hero and someone as precious as you become so vicious and ugly because of hunger for power. I have now become afraid of power. That is why I did not join any group or party after you removed me from the primary membership of the party using the dirtiest and filthiest falsehood.I remember in one volunteer meeting in Santacruz where we had a public argument. You felt that we should not give any importance to volunteers, they were just tools. I publicly contradicted you saying that these were some of the finest humans who had sacrificed for the nation. They are NOT pawns to be used?and-thrown.Look around you almost all of the original volunteers who had left everything to join for the principles have been removed, quit or are inactive.In our scheme of things our volunteers were supposed to be the primary unit of the party so I ask on their behalf. How did you select Ashutosh, Ashish Khetan and others in the national team? Why has no internal election taken place? When is the donation list coming back on the website? Who is accountable for the loss in Punjab, Goa and now Delhi, were the volunteers asked or informed? The questions are innumerable but let us ask with these basic ones.You took complete power by becoming convener as well as CM of Delhi. How much more power do you want before you start delivering alternative politics? In your pursuit for power, you have betrayed my beloved nation. You have messed up the life of millions who followed you. They gave you complete power ?made you convener and CM. Delhi gave you 67 seats just two years back. What more do you want? I do not know whether you know the reality or are living in denial - but are a very unpopular man in the country. If you do more drama, then it is going to get worse and we cannot afford that. Dear Arvind, I have seen you turn 180 degrees from what you were. After your complete rejection in Punjab, Goa and now in Delhi, can I expect you to introspect and make another 180 degree turn? Abandon the agenda of wanting to be another BJP and Cong. We had come to fight them not become another version of them. Follow our original agenda that might get back the respect and credibility that you have completely lost with your foolish and vote bank oriented comments. Get back credible and independent people in the core team. For now, forget your national ambitions and focus on governing Delhi well, that is your only chance of staying relevant. Stop dramas and blaming. We still need the principles; we still need to fight corrupts; we still need to fight against criminalization of politics. We still need to fight against caste and communal politics. The parties that use these tools are still around. Our AAP was formed to fight that. But, for that, AAP needs to transform.

Nepotism has always been a hot topic in Bollywood, and when three industry bigwigs yelled ?nepotism rocks? in front of thousands of fans at the 2017 IIFA Awards, they were slammed in the press. Saif wrote about the negative stories published about the issue. ?What I can?t seem to understand are some of the media reactions to this.

The film industry is the most fair line of work. So yes, maybe I got a chance because of my mother, but that is more genetics than nepotism.

The supreme court is expected to order Sharif be tried Sharif on corruption charges, or disqualify him, but few expect the judges to dismiss the case after the panel tabled a damaging 254-page report into his family wealth. Sharif has denied any wrongdoing after the report alleged his family?s vast wealth was beyond their means and accused his children, including presumed heir Maryam, of signing forged documents to obscure ownership of four flats in London?s Mayfair. Sharif, 67, has rejected demands by opposition parties to resign, warning his replacement would destabilise the country and imperil hard-won economic gains since his poll victory in 2013.?It hurts that despite all of our hard work, attempts are afoot once again to push the country back,? Sharif told a meeting of his ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party at the weekend.In April Sharif narrowly escaped disqualification after the supreme court ruled there was insufficient evidence to remove him ? by a 2-3 split ? over documents released by the Panama Papers leak into offshore wealth. But it ordered further investigations, and the formation of the joint investigation team (JIT) panel. Sharif has talked of a conspiracy against him, but has not named anyone. His allies, however, privately claim that elements of Pakistan?s powerful military and the judiciary are bent on toppling him. The army spokesman brushed aside questions about claims the military?s hidden hand was the driving force behind the JIT investigation, saying ?the Pakistan army is not directly connected?. The six-person JIT panel included one member from the military intelligence agency and another from the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, the country?s top spy agency. Sharif, the son of an industrialist, is serving his third term in power and has had a fractious relationship with the army. He was originally nurtured by the military as a civilian politician who would protect their interests, and he served as prime minister twice in the 1990s. But relations soured and his second stint as prime minister ended when he was ousted in a 1999 coup leading to a decade of exile. Relations with the military during the current term have also been tense. Sharif?s legal team and the opposition will be given a chance to contest the JIT findings and Sharif is also expected to be summoned to appear before the court in coming days or weeks. Opposition politicians say Sharif is concocting claims of conspiracy to save his skin and argue that if he really wanted to protect democracy he should step down. Imran Khan, the opposition leader who pushed the hardest for Sharif to be investigated, said the prime minister would end up in jail, and vowed protests if he was not ousted by the court. ?Either we will celebrate in Islamabad or otherwise we will hit the streets to save our democracy and to make sure we send this mafia to Adiyala jail,?

But as an individual, I think it is necessary... I mean who does not go to the toilet?\"However, he is hopeful that things will change.\"Our youth is very strong minded. They understand the necessity of using the toilet. Some people are starting to talk about it, which is great... It means awareness has been created. See, it is also about the mindset.

It is also strange that the bank does not know of what happened to the money it lent to the company. It doesn\\'t know if the company has been declared a defaulter,\" said Dhingra.While Mail Today was the first to report that such a loan, nearly Rs 55 crore, had been given to Mallya\\'s Kingfisher Airlines by the Oriental Bank of Commerce-led consortium, the latter had been stonewalling giving information regarding who approved the loan and on what grounds, such as collaterals etc, by invoking Section 8 (1) (h) of the RTI Act. The bank had argued that the matter was pending before different investigating agencies and disclosure of the information could hamper the investigation process. The concerned enforcement agencies are the CBI, ED and the SFIO.SUPREME COURT PRECEDENTThe CIC had earlier, at the case hearing on February 10, questioned the invoking of the exemption clause. In its latest judgment in the case, the CIC quoted several judgments from the Supreme Court as well as the Delhi High Court and observed that the bank had to furnish information asked by Dhingra and that the exemption did not apply.IC Sharat Sabharwal observed: \"Except for stating that the matter is under investigation of some agencies, the respondents (bank) have not made any other submission to justify invocation of Section 8 (1) (h) to deny most of the information and why its disclosure would hamper the investigation process. As stated above, the investigation agencies have chosen not to make any submission in spite of an opportunity given to them for the purpose.\"The IC also cited that the exemption clause itself made it clear that \"a public authority may allow access to information, if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.\"The IC also quoted, among others, an SC observation in the case of UP Financial Corporation vs gem Cap India Pvt (AIR 1993, 1435). \"In fact, information about industrialists who are loan defaulters of the country may put pressure on such persons to pay their dues.\"', 'The BJP achieved a landslide victory in the Uttarakhand assembly elections 2017.

My leadership may not have been up to the mark and resulted in the party\\'s failure,\" said Chief Minister Harish Rawat.While the Congress still managed to win some seats, the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party was completely decimated in the Uttarakhand assembly election.NO TRACE OF BSPMayawati-led Bahujan Samajwadi Party proved the axis poll predictions right as they were entirely decimated in the Uttarakhand Assembly election. 637 candidates including 56 women contested in 70 seats of the Uttarakhand Assembly.', 'Delhi could soon lose all its seven elephants with the state forest department planning to shift them to a sanctuary outside the national capital. ?It would be wiser to shift them to safer confines with relatively larger natural environs away from human habitation,? said a report prepared by the forest department. The report has been submitted to the high court earlier this month.The city has seven domesticated elephants owned by four people. While six are kept at Sangam Vihar in Wazirabad, one is kept at a JJ cluster in Laxmi Nagar.The owners of the elephants have requested the forest officials not to separate them from the elephants as the animals would die without them. They have instead requested the forest department to give them a plot of land where they can move with the animals. ?We have asked the owners to respond within four weeks. If they don?t respond, we would shift the elephants to some area outside Delhi,? said AK Shukla, chief wildlife warden of Delhi In 2016, a committee comprising wildlife officials had recommended that all the elephants should be confiscated as their health was poor and the animals were kept in bad conditions. The owners, however, moved court challenging the committee?s report. In May 2017, a separate committee was formed on the orders of the court which inspected the elephants again. The report was submitted earlier this month. The five-member committee comprised officials of the forest department, the central zoo authority and the vet of the National Zoological Park in New Delhi. The committee, after inspecting the animals, found that not only the elephants were kept in poor conditions but it was also risky to keep the elephants in crowded localities. A number of cases have been earlier reported where domesticated elephants have gone on a rampage killing people. ?Housing elephants inside a crowded and congested colony is a high-risk affair. The risk was compounded as there were neither any secondary barriers to restrain the elephants in case they broke the chain with which they are tied, nor there were any tranquilising guns or medicines to restrict them,? the report said. The committee found that most of the animals were suffering from poor health which suggests that they were not properly fed and don?t undertake exercises such as long walks. They have cracked nails which suggest they have very poor foot care. ?Sometimes they are made to walk through a maze of traffic dust and exhaust fumes which they may find terrifying? the report states. The committee has also raised questions about their ownerships. The report states that most of the elephants have no proper ownership certificates. ?The elephants are like our family members. We would die without them. We have proper license to keep them. It is only because of some animal right activists and influential NGOs that we are being made victims. We will again approach the court if necessary,? said Yusuf Ali, whose family owns three elephants.

In other words, the government currently is processing applications filed in May of 2005,? the report said.Pew said from fiscal 2010 to 2014, about 36% of employment-related Green cards more than 222,000 were granted to H-1B visa holders.Green Card, is the immigration status of a person authorised to live and work in the US permanently. A Green Card holder can apply for US citizenship after five years of residency. This period is shortened to three years if married to a US citizenGreen Card holders who adjusted their status are more likely than new arrivals to be in their prime working years of 25 to 64. Among those who adjusted their status, 72 per cent were of ages 25 to 64, compared with 55 per cent of new arrivals, the research report said.According to the study, in every fiscal year since 2004, the US has issued more Green Cards to immigrants living in the country on another visa who adjust their legal status than to new arrivals.In 2015, there were 508,716 new arrivals who received lawful permanent residency in the form of a Green Card and 542,315 people adjusted their status, it said.In every fiscal year since 2004, the US has issued more Green Cards to immigrants living in the country on another visa who adjusted their legal status than to new arrivals.Since 2004, a total of 7.4 million people who adjusted their status and 5.5 million new arrivals have received lawful permanent residency in the form of a Green Card, the study said.Employment-related categories (including workers? family members) accounted for 14 per cent of 2015 Green Cards.Refugees (11 per cent) and people granted asylum (3 per cent) together made up a similar share, it said.There is also a ?diversity? category for people from countries with historically low rates of US immigration (5 per cent). ', 'When India lost to arch-rivals Pakistan in Sunday\\'s Champions Trophy cricket final match in London, it not only broke millions of hearts but also left hundreds of bettors and bookmakers broke. According to an estimate, over 80-90 per cent Indian punters staked their money on the Men in Blue who were the firm favourites with a brilliant 12-2 record against their neighbours in ICC events. A total of Rs 2,000-2,500 crore was riding on the match that transfixed two nations and received eye-popping media coverage. Legal gambling in India is confined to horse-racing while casinos are allowed only in a couple of states. Sikkim is the only state that allows betting on sports including cricket. But the underground market in the country is worth thousands of crores, say observers. NO BETS ON HOCKEY MATCHBookies told Mail Today that huge sums of money were riding on Team India- not just within the country but also gambling hubs abroad such as in the Gulf nations- as this was one of the most-anticipated sporting events in months. However, there were no takers in the betting bazaar for the Hockey World League semi-final game on Sunday in which India demolished Pakistan 7-1. \"When the (cricket) match started, the odds were in favour of India. If the Men in Blue would have won the match, then punters would have earned 80 paise for every rupee while Pakistan\\'s rate was around Rs 3.40,\" a Delhi-based bookie told this reporter. Pakistan inflicted a massive 180-run defeat upon title-holders and favourites India at the Oval in London to win the tournament featuring the world\\'s top eight one-day international nations. PATRIOTISM MATTERS IN BETSThe bookmaker said almost all his 50-60 customers lost money as they had placed their bets on India. Till India dropped two early wickets, the rate chart in the gambling circuit was in favour Virat Kohli\\'s boys. Even the massive total of 338 put up by Pakistan failed to deter bookies. History was unequivocally on India\\'s side. The team had comprehensively beaten Pakistan when they met in the group stage. Experts claim that in an India-Pakistan match, patriotism plays a key role for bettors. \"It is certain that most of the Indian punters burnt their fingers in the match. The Indian team was stronger and had also defeated Pakistan in the tournament earlier, so huge money was riding on it. Even patriotism was at an all- time high and maximum bets were placed on Team India,\" said Jay Sayta, founder of GLaws.in, a gaming laws\\' web portal. According to experts, gambling was at its peak during the match as the viewership too was massive with premium advertisement rates. \"Not only Indians, but many international punters too burnt their fingers by putting money on India. Even after Pakistan ended their batting and put up a huge score before India, the odds were in favour of Virat\\'s team due to the strong batting line-up and ability to chase down big totals,\" said another bookie from Mumbai. SIKKIM BOOKIES ON FIREThe only legal outlet for sports betting in India, which is in Sikkim, also witnessed a sharp rise in business volume. \"Our feeds before the match started were in favour of India as the rate was 1.6 while the rate for Pakistan was over 2.20. This means that if a player had placed Rs 100 on Pakistan, then he or she would have got Rs 220 in return. But most of the people invested on India,\" said Ratul Sethi of Golden Gaming. Sethi explained that the rates at the sports betting zone change at frequent intervals and as the game moved on rates shifted in favour of Pakistan. \"Not everyone playing at our outlet lost money as players can invest on different probables like scores in an over, next wicket, run rates, etc. We also promote sensible gaming so we advise players to place their bets reasonably,\" Sethi said. However, he said there were no takers for the India-Pakistan hockey match. While gambling is illegal in the country, Indians can lay their bets through UK websites with international credit cards and e-wallets. The bets are not only placed on the outcome of a match but also on other factors.Also read: Breaking TV sets, burning posters to crying on roads; How Indian fans found closure after Champions Trophy defeat ', 'The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday threatened to suspend a venue for two years if it accumulated 10 demerit points for substandard pitches and outfields during international matches.The ICC in its three-day meeting agreed to the changes made to the pitch and outfield monitoring process, which stated that venues and boards should be more accountable for the standard of pitches and outfields they present for international matches.It also stated that there should be consequences for a venue if it presents conditions that make it unsafe for an international match to proceed, without mitigating circumstances or regularly presents substandard conditions for international cricket.

Ma?gorzata Gersdorf told her colleagues in an open letter read out at a recent gathering of judges in Warsaw. ?What was until now a threat is becoming a reality.?In its latest battle with Poland?s legal system, the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) says it wants to ?democratise? the way Polish judges are appointed, which at the moment is a job for the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), an autonomous body whose judicial members are chosen by their peers.Under the government?s proposals, however, the terms of all the judicial members of the council would be terminated within 90 days of the draft law?s enactment. Their replacements would be selected by the Polish parliament, with the speaker of the parliament given discretion as to which candidates should be put forward for consideration.Whereas the council?s judicial members presently enjoy a majority, under the government?s proposals the body would be split into two chambers, one for judicial members and the other for political representatives. Both chambers would have to agree to an appointment or a resolution, giving the political representatives a veto over decisions made by the judicial members.?The government?s proposals will be an instrument for ensuring the appointment of the ?right? kind of judges who will not be too critical of the authorities and their political programme,? said Ewa ??towska, a professor at Poland?s Institute of Legal Sciences and a former judge who served on the country?s constitutional tribunal and the supreme administrative court.The council was given less than three working days to respond to the draft act, receiving it from the Ministry of Justice on a Thursday and expected to provide its official response by the following Tuesday. In a strongly worded statement, it described the proposals as ?in obvious and gross contradiction with the Polish constitution?.?The council is an independent constitutional organ that was instituted in 1989 in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary, because in the communist era everything was dependent on the ruling party,? Dariusz Zawistowski, chairman of the KRS and a serving supreme court judge, told the Guardian.?When members of the council are elected by the parliament, this function of safeguarding the constitution will be pure fiction. Formally speaking, there would be no independent judiciary.?Gersdorf has urged her fellow judges to risk their own positions in the fight against the proposals.?There is no fight without victims, and among them may be counted some of us present here,? said Gersdorf?s letter to her fellow judges. ?To win, you must be prepared even for disciplinary tribunals, to be removed from office, for anything. You must show that we are in opposition to the pushing of a democratic state into oblivion.?The government describes the proposals as ?enhancing democracy and independence? by freeing the appointments process from ?the corporate interests of the judicial environment?, citing the judicial appointments process in countries such as Spain and Germany.?Objectivity in selecting members of the National Council of the Judiciary and their independence from corporate interests is to be ensured by them being selected by the Sejm, which holds a mandate gained in democratic elections. A similar system is successful for instance in Spain,? said the Ministry of Justice in a statement.But the KRS?s response rejects such comparisons. ?It must be recalled that in accordance with article 8(1) of the constitution, it is the constitution of the Republic of Poland of 2 April 1997 that is the supreme law in the Republic of Poland, and not the constitution of Spain of 31 October 1978 or the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany of 23 May 1949.?The controversy is the latest front in a protracted battle between the PiS and an increasingly demoralised judiciary.Shortly after assuming power in late 2015, the government merged the office of prosecutor general with that of the justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, a move that some analysts argue has already allowed the government to exert political pressure on judges.?We have already seen numerous examples of prosecutors answerable to the minister of justice initiating criminal proceedings against judges who have reached decisions they don?t agree with,? said ??towska.', 'More than 20,000 resident doctors in the national capital on Thursday went on mass casual leave in solidarity with their Maharashtra counterparts, leading to postponement of over 800 surgeries across Delhi government and civic body-run hospitals, and also left thousands of patients in the lurch with OPD functions hit.Resident doctors in Delhi went on mass casual leave in solidarity with a similar move by their Maharashtra counterparts over rising cases of assault on doctors by patients? kin.According to hospital staff, due to resident doctors remaining absent from their duties the OPD registration counters were shut in several government hospitals after 10am, instead of the usual time 1pm, compelling patients to return.   ?At Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) the OPD card counters were shut immediately after the resident doctors went off their duties as part of mass casual leave. Many patients had no idea initially and kept standing in the queue,? said Sanjana Rawat, a nurse at LHMC.There are 38 hospitals under the Delhi government. Resident doctors in hospitals under the central government, except the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, were also part of the protest. Delhi government hospitals every day witness nearly 1,600 pre-scheduled surgeries and over 200 emergency ones.Patients in several other government hospitals such as Lal Bahadur Sastri Hospital, Dadadev Mother and Child Hospital and GB Pant were affected as only the emergency departments were functional and even the normal medicine OPD remained partially operational.?Nearly 60 per cent of patients at Dadadev Mother and Child hospital could not get doctors consultation or treatment due to the protest. However, the emergency cases were somehow treated as resident doctors having duty in emergency department were not part of the protest,? said Nirupam Ghosh, associated with the administration wing of Dadadev Mother and Child hospital. Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) -- under whose banner the protest was being held in Delhi -- said of the 5,400 OPD cards registered in Delhi government hospitals on Thursday only 25 per cent of patients could consult doctors. The resident doctors have also threatened to go on a pan India strike soon if the government fails to ensure them a safe atmosphere to perform their duties. ?This mass casual leave was just an indication of what we can do to ensure our safety. If the health ministry does not take necessary steps to stop assault on doctors we will go on pan India strike,? said Pankaj Solanki, President FORDA, told IANS.Several private hospitals also came out in support of the protest by resident doctors.Sir Ganga Ram Hospital chairman DS Rana said that in solidarity with the ?concerns of safety of doctors? the general and private OPDs of the hospital will not function on Friday. The inpatient as well as emergency services will function normally.City-based Fortis condemned the rising cases of assault on doctors, but added the hospital will continue to function normally.?A safe and secure work environment is the basic requirement for care givers to provide best possible medical care to patients. We at Fortis Healthcare are firmly committed to our patients, and our medical services remain unhampered as our doctors continue to serve the community, as always,? a statement said.As part of the protest, resident doctors have also decided to sport black arm bands on March 24 during work.', 'From Aditi Khanna London, Feb 19 (PTI)Â\\xa0One of the UKs leading umbrella group for Hindus has said the Bank of England has assured them that concerns over the use of animal fat in the new five-pound notes were being treated with \"utmost seriousness\" and the new 20 pound notes would be launched only after consultations.

The civic agency has invited tenders for installing the toilet vans at earmarked sites across 104 wards on Friday. An amount of Rs 12 crore has been allocated for the project.According to officials, the project aims to supplement the efforts of Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) and Railways ?the agencies responsible for providing infrastructure facilities in slums.?Densely populated areas, especially those located close to railway lines, have no space for constructing community toilets. That?s why we have decided to place mobile toilet vans here. These includes slum clusters in Okhla, Nizamuddin and Tuglakabad,? said a senior official from department of environment management services, SDMC.?During the survey, we also found that colonies like Sangam Vihar have no sewer lines. Since the work doesn?t belong to us, we have decided to place mobile vans to stop people from defecating in the open,? the official said.According to parameters of the Swachh Bharat Mission, any urban local body can declare its wards ODF only if it is successful in providing public conveniences at 75% of its areas. Also, there should be provision for toilets within 500 metres of slum settlements.Assuming that these norms would be fulfilled over the period of time, the South Corporation, in May, made its preliminary resolution public and declared 92 of 104 wards open defecation-free. The agency had invited feedback and objections from residents, but failed to get any response.However, later on, during the meetings with officials of various agencies (whose land fall under the SDMC?s jurisdiction) it was found that people living in slums (located near railway tracks) are still defecating in the open.?This increased our worries as implementation of the project was not as simple as it looked. We had to request the DUSIB and Railways to speed up construction of toilets and if there is no land, they should approach other agencies,? said a senior official.But since the implementation of this was taking time, the agency decided to place mobile toilets. ?We want everything to be in place before the Gandhi Jayanti (October 2), when Swachh Bharat Abhiyan will also complete its three years,? said the official. After SDMC?s final resolution, an independent team from the ministry of urban development will conduct survey of these areas before declaring them ODF.', 'Actor Zayed Khan, who was in Delhi to attend his friend designer Manav Gangwani?s fashion show, shared his thoughts on the on-going nepotism debate in Bollywood, and also spoke about his television debut.

Hasn?t everybody coming up [in this industry] used their influence to help their loved ones or keep their loved ones in a better position? It is merely human nature.

The data also shows that monetary relief to the tune of Rs 6.47 crore was recommended in 117 cases. ?It is not known whether this was ex-gratia relief granted or compensation awarded. Further, it is not known how many complainants or victims actually received the monetary relief and which government (Central or State) made the payments,?

I made a mistake. But we were on the winning side,\" he said at Salaam Cricket Conclave 2014, a day-long event organised by the India Today Group in New Delhi.On being asked what has been his best mistake, Ganguly quipped, \"When I got married.\" When asked if marriage is akin to captaining India since the first five years are tough, Ganguly quoted actor Shah Rukh Khan, \"As SRK says, end mein sab theek ho jaata hai,\" bringing the house down.The former Indian skipper also said a resurgent Team India will not buckle pressure anymore. \"In 2003, we lost to the best Aussie side under Ricky Ponting. But today, the Indians won\\'t buckle under pressure,\" the former Indian captain said.Seated with Clive Lloyd, Arjuna Ranatunga and Allan Border, who all led their respective teams to a World Cup victory, Ganguly, in his characteristic wit, shared the Indian side of the World Cup story. Ganguly-led India lost to Australia in the finals of the 2003 World Cup in South Africa.Speaking in the session, \\'Pressures of the World Cup\\', Ganguly remembered the loss, saying it was very difficult to captain India because of the huge expectations involved. \"Stones were thrown at us after the Johannesburg loss. We Indians react under pressure. But we are used to it (pressure).

We were fighting,\" the southpaw told Sardesai.Speaking about the toss controversy - when Ganguly kept Waugh waiting - the former Indian captain said he was only looking for a blazer. He also praised the Aussie legend, saying it was great playing against him. In turn, Waugh said he loved playing against India. \"At the end of the day, it was fantastic cricket. I have no regret that we lost,\" the former Aussie captain said.Talking about pressure in a World Cup ahead of its 2015 edition in Australia, Border said, \"This country is so passionate about cricket.\"Clive Lloyd, the legendary winner of World Cups 1975 and 1979 for the West Indies, said, \"Pressure is always there. We are a side comprising players from different islands, representing different cultures. England is one country. India is one country. It\\'s very difficult to get people together in West Indies.

Several people, mostly labourers working in the university, queue up with containers near the freak neem tree for their daily fix. They like it better than off-the-shelf liquor; moreover, it comes free.?A neem tree has been secreting a white liquid since November 2016. It smells of toddy (naturally alcoholic sap of palm) and tastes somewhat bitter. But people from the campus and outside collect it to drink. They say it is intoxicating,? said Mahesh Prasad, the head gardener of North Campus.There are around 15 neem trees near the rugby stadium towards the back end of the campus, most of which are more than 50 years old. But only one tree is giving out the sap ? at least 10 litres a day.?This is unusual. It is for the first time that we have witnessed anything of this sort in Delhi,? said CR Babu, professor emeritus at Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE) in Delhi University.Like any watering hole, it?s easy to locate the inebriating tree. The strong beer-like scent can be smelled at least 10 feet, or even more, from the tree. The charade of bottles, buckets and pitchers is also a good enough sign.?I had two to three glasses of the toddy. It was quite intoxicating. I didn?t fall ill after that. As it is a neem tree, I think, it also has some medicinal properties,? said a labourer, in high spirits.Someone has also placed a ladder and tied a bucket right at the source. Not a drop to be wasted.?The liquid was coming out from near a joint of two branches. But then, it stopped and started to come out from a different place. The flow is gradually slowing down. The smell is also becoming weaker,? said Vikrant Goswami, a scientific assistant at CEMDE.Scientists from the university?s department of environmental studies are testing ? in the laboratory ? samples of the liquid.?We suspect it is not the kind of toddy which we usually get from palm trees. There is some kind of microbial activity going on inside the tree. The microbe is helping the tree sap to ferment,? said Dr David Kothamasi, assistant professor at the department.It would take at least a month for the test results to be available. In the lab, too, the bottle in which the toddy has been capped started to inflate when its cap was sealed. That?s a signal that the fermentation process has not stopped. Scientists said a similar incident was reported in Varanasi a few years ago. Tests revealed the presence of salicyclic acid, a key ingredient in aspirin.The evergreen neem is the magic tree of Ayurvedic medicine, and is called sarva roga nivarini or the one that prevents and cures all diseases.

The RBI?argued that the banks collected these notes after they were demonetised on November 8 last year. The banks have decided to move court against the RBI?s decision.

At the time, these 31 DCCBs had Rs2,771.86 crore in banned notes. Cooperative banks in Pune and Nashik are left with Rs22.25 crore and Rs23 crore in scrapped notes, while Kolhapur has Rs25.27 crore. The RBI?also turned away banks in Ahmednagar (Rs11.68crore), Nagpur (Rs5.02crore) and Sangali (Rs14.72 crore). ?We are yet to receive the total amount of the stock lying with other DCCBs, but it could be more than Rs200 crore. It is discriminatory that when the scheduled, centralized, urban banks were allowed to deposit their notes collected before demonetisation, only DCCBs were singled out. The stock with the DCCBs was verified by the National Bank For Agriculture And Rural Development on various occasions and they had found nothing objectionable. We are considering to move court against the RBI,? said Swati Pande, chief executive officer, Maharashtra State Cooperative Banks Association. In case of some DCCBs, the RBI has found discrepancies in the records such as difference between their actual stock and the records. The DCCBs have been given token slips for the unaccepted notes. ?We have moved the Supreme Court, seeking direction to the RBI to accept scrapped notes.

Its not that National awards are not prestigious, but it doesnt take away the fact whatever the film has achieved. \"We did not make a film for that purpose, so its ok. An award is given when your efforts are rewarded. So, the people who have won, have put in more efforts and have been rewarded, so you shouldnt feel spiteful to somebodys elses win. Thats the wrong way of looking at it,\" Alia told reporters here. She was speaking on the sidelines of International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) awards press meet of voting weekend. \"Udta Punjab\" also had Shahid Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor and Diljit Dosanjh were in key roles.

Whatsapp messages? like ?Wear an Indian Rakhi if you care about your country? have started being circulated in the city.Raksha Bandhan is among the six major festivals that the Sangh celebrates and the campaign comes amid an increasingly bitter New Delhi-Beijing standoff over Doklam, which is under China?s control but claimed by Bhutan. This, Sangh leaders say, has prompted them to think of ways to weaken the Chinese financially.?This time we are going to encourage both traders and buyers not to sell Chinese Rakhi?we want to make the people aware of the sinister designs of the dragon and how by cooperating with us they can help deflate the Chinese ambitions,? said RSS pracharak Mahirajdhwaj Singh, who is associated with the MRM. The RSS has previously campaigned against Chinese crackers during Diwali and its chief, Mohan Bhagwat, called for a boycott of Chinese goods earlier this year.The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), an RSS affiliate floated to promote Indian products, will follow up the initiative with a two-day meeting in Gonda from July 29. Part of the campaign includes door-to-door contacts, making people aware of how the Chinese are allying with Pakistan to create disturbances in India. Sangh volunteers at the Gonda meeting will discuss ways to create awareness among people to boycott Chinese products. Bhola Nath, who is associated with the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, told HT that a massive rally would be organised in Delhi?s Ramlila grounds in October. During the rally, the Modi government will be urged to opt out of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). ?China is cunningly using the WTO to flood the Indian market with cheap goods.

He was produced before a court which remanded him in 14-day judicial custody.Here are the details:', 'The Supreme Court noted on Friday a sharp rise in pleas from women seeking to abort pregnancies beyond the legally permissible time limit while rejecting a 10-year-old rape survivor?s request to terminate her 32-week pregnancy. Medical opinion placed before the court said the abortion would not be in the interest of either the girl or the foetus.A bench headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar asked the central government to consider setting up a permanent medical board in every state to quickly decide on pleas from pregnant women asking for terminations beyond the permissible 20-week period. The bench said these boards were needed to save time because such cases were coming to the courts in a ?big way?.This year, the Supreme Court has received at least seven petitions from women, including teenage rape survivors, asking to terminate pregnancies beyond 20 weeks. The top court disallowed abortions in two, including Friday?s, lawyers said.Courts allow terminations beyond that in the rarest of circumstances if doctors say it is necessary to save the mother?s life.Friday?s order came after the court perused the report of an expert panel set up by the PGI, Chandigarh, to find out ?whether the health of the girl concerned and the child would be adversely affected if the pregnancy is allowed to be full term?.The bench expressed satisfaction over the medical care being provided to the rape survivor and dismissed the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a lawyer seeking the abortion.To the court?s suggestion on setting up permanent medical boards in states, solicitor general Ranjit Kumar said he would inform the court whether such boards can operate while amendments to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTPA), 1971, considered extending the time-limit from 20 to 24 weeks.The girl, who hails from Chandigarh, was repeatedly raped by her uncle. Her parents were poor and had approached the Chandigarh district court for permission to terminate the pregnancy. On July 18, the court dismissed the plea, citing the 20-week ceiling. A lawyer then went to the top court.The girl was allegedly raped over seven months. Her parents got to know of it when they took her to a doctor after she complained of a stomach pain, her parents said.In another case a bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra allowed a 21-year-old woman from Mumbai to abort her 22-week-old foetus following a medical opinion that post-birth the child will have severe mental impairment.A three-member panel of experts from JJ Hospital concluded the foetus suffered from Hydrocephalus, or accumulation of fluid in the brain. The court asked the woman to approach JJ Hospital for the termination, which it said should be done soon.

The institutes now have technology-driven teaching interface in all classrooms, bio-metric entry for students, paperless admissions and mobile apps for better teacher-parent interaction. The education society also plans to introduce online assessment of all examinations soon.?Paperless admissions have not only reduced the work of our staff but have also made the process very transparent for everybody. Parents are also happy as they get daily updates about their child?s attendance in college without even having to visit the institute,? said AH Rizvi, president, Rizvi Education Society. The society spent around Rs1 crore and took seven months to implement the first phase.He added that in the second phase, the education society plans to start online assessment of exam papers and make study material available online for all its 6,000 school and college students.The management trained its teachers in collaboration with a technology provider to ensure the final implementation is foolproof.  Also, CCTV cameras were installed in all its institutes and all laboratories were equipped with latest technology. ?Our attempt to digitise almost all our academic functions right from admissions to the generation of results has been very fruitful. We intend to digitise the infrastructure, administration as well as teaching-learning process to ensure a 360 degree effort,? said Rubina Rizvi, director, Rizvi Education Society.', 'In a u-turn the Election Commission said on Wednesday that it cannot take a stand on a demand to bar convicted politicians for life from contesting polls, prompting the Supreme Court to criticise the poll panel for shying away from a crucial issue.?Is silence an option for you? You must say either yes or no. How can you be silent? If you are constrained please let us know,? a bench headed by Justice Ranjan Gogoi asked the EC counsel whose submission was a departure from the stand the commission took in its affidavit.In response to a public interest litigation raising the demand, the EC had on April filed an affidavit where it supported the petitioner?s plea. The short affidavit said the commission supported the cause of the petitioner to decriminalise politics. When the court asked the commission?s lawyer, the latter replied: ?The commission is not taking an adversarial stand. We feel the issue (debarring convicted politicians) is in the legislative domain and we have no stand.??If you feel constrained by the legislature then let us know,? the bench shot back at the counsel. The Centre has already made its stand clear on the issue by opposing the petition. In its affidavit in April it had said that the court should not pass orders on the issue as this is a matter best decided by the Parliament.The court also took a swipe at the petitioner for invoking Article 14 (right to equality) in the case. The petitioner had contended that while a convicted bureaucrat and judicial officer lose his or their jobs, the same principle should apply to convicted politicians.?Are you espousing the cause of public servants, complaining of discrimination on the ground of Article 14,? the bench told the petitioner, fixing July 19 to hear the matter again.Under the Representation of the People Act, a politician convicted and sentenced to a jail term of two years or more shall be disqualified from contesting polls for six years from the date of his release from prison after conclusion of the term.The poll panel had said in its affidavit it was ?alive to the issues that concern the conduct of free and fair elections and functioning of healthy democracy and as such asserting for bringing in electoral reforms which further the cause of free and fair elections.?', \"Chris Froome has said he was deliberately knocked off his bike by a hit-and-run driver while training in southern France.The three-time Tour de France winner posted a picture of his broken bike on Twitter but said he was not hurt in the incident.The Team Sky rider wrote: ?Just got rammed on purpose by an impatient driver who followed me onto the pavement!

The grades are Rs 2 crore, Rs 1 crore and Rs 50 lakh.While the elite Indian cricketers are a sorted lot along with a handful of first-class players, who have IPL contracts, an average domestic cricketer still gets a match fee of Rs 1.5 lakh (first XI player) for a first-class game (Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy) compared to the Rs 15 lakh for a Test match.One of India\\'s finest spinners, Harbhajan has recently written to Kumble about the financial insecurities of domestic cricketers.The letter, accessed by PTI, has Harbhajan making an emotional plea to Kumble.\"It\\'s been last 2/3 years (that) I am playing Ranji Trophy.

First, the top order: they?re all left-handers, they?re all crabby, and with Alastair Cook?s form fading, they all struggle to deal with the stock Test-match delivery. In 12 innings, Cook, Keaton Jennings and Gary Ballance have made 246 at an average of 20, which is one shaky set of foundations. Second, Mark Wood. The quickest of England?s bowlers has also been the least incisive: he has one for 197 off 56 overs. Chris Woakes?s recovery from injury cannot come too soon.Third, Liam Dawson. A resourceful cricketer who bowled one great ball to dismiss Amla at Lord?s, Dawson is summed up by one stat: in his whole career, he has taken five wickets in a first-class innings three times. The equivalent figure for Adil Rashid is 19. As a pair, Rashid and Moeen Ali may be expensive, but at least they are penetrating. Dawson is not. He is a bits-and-pieces player who is not even making runs.Fourth, the balance of the side. The batting order is more like a disorder ? too quiet at first, then too noisy, with three blockers followed by Root and four dashers. The selectors can be faulted for two things: preferring Dawson to Rashid, and picking only four specialist batsmen ? two of whom, Jennings and Ballance, are now walking wickets.Updated\\nat 3.35pm BST\\n\\n\\n3.17pm BST\\n15:17\\n\\nOn a day like this, we?re all armchair selectors. And some wise heads are already gathering for the meeting...Jeremy Smith: ?The reality is that England?s best number three is still Jonathan Trott, a 36-year-old who retired from international cricket two years ago on health grounds.?Zia Faruqui: ?Are Buttler or Morgan really the solution? Surely both play in the same single devil-may-care mode as the current incumbents? Need Hameed back.?Neil Virani: ?I?m quite amazed by people calling for Test players based on ODI performances. This match and several before are an indictment of employing a Test coach based on his short-form record. Bayliss seems to think every Test pitch is 500 par and every ODI pitch 350 par, and refuses to tell his team to adapt to the conditions.?Ashley Roberts: ?We need to talk about Bayliss. He has been in the job for a few years now but I?m struggling to see how he has improved this Test team. England have batted appallingly in this match, but I think they are a lot more talented than this, which begs the question: why are they all giving their wickets away? Shouldn?t the coach have some influence over that and their type of play?

You?ve got to laugh.?\\n\\n3.09pm BST\\n15:09\\n\\nSo England were awful, but isn?t this great for the series? There is nothing worse than back-to-back Tests producing an instant 2-0, especially when there are only two Tests to come.

There?s now a week off, and a chance for England to regroup.\\n\\n3.06pm BST\\n15:06\\n\\nThe first thing to say is not that England were awful, but South Africa were vastly improved. They bowled well, batted resolutely, fielded smartly, and above all they were well led. My colleague Rob Smyth reckons the man of the match should be Faf du Plessis, on the John Abrahams principle, and although it?s unlikely to happen, it may well be right.

As has been pointed out, at least they have demonstrated the ability to get runs against international bowling attacks, under the sort of pressure which playing international sport brings. With modern run rates and batting approaches who?s to say there isn?t overall more in common between ODIs and Tests than there is between Tests and county cricket?

Not yet; maiden. \\n\\n2.22pm BST\\n14:22\\n\\n38th over: England 120-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 25) A rare quiet over for South Africa, Maharaj struggling manfully to stem the flow of runs ... then, after just a single ceded from the over, Moeen drives its final ball, Morkel keels over but can?t stop it properly, and after some tricklage, England add four more. I?ve been sent a fair few messages checking that i was joking about Buttler and solidity - I can confirm that I was. ?You can never be too sure these days; apparently Liam Dawson as a frontline spinner is deadly serious,? snarks Miles Dilworth.

I smell a bouncer - and Moeen will too, I shouldn?t wonder.

Bairstow then follows one around his pads, but can?t quite apply the edge that will send him on his merry way. Instead, he flicks the final delivery for four through midwicket. ?Root?s dislike of Rashid isn?t personal,? reassures John Starbuck, ?it?s because he?s prejudiced against wrist-spinners, who leak more runs but take more wickets than the offies. As a batsman himself, the prospect of having to score more is unwelcome.?I?m not sure about that - I?d imagine he might also consider who and what he?d fancy facing. Maybe he doesn?t deem Rashid?s risk worth the potential reward, but if the batsmen do their job properly they can afford a luxury leg-spinner. \\n\\n1.41pm BST\\n13:41\\n\\nThe players are back with us.

It just seems so odd given that Rashid is a good batsman in his own right as well.?He?s played Tests with him too - presumably he didn?t like what he saw. Which isn?t to say that i get it. \\n\\n1.32pm BST\\n13:32\\n\\n?Well, this is going well,? says Guy Hornsby of\\n\\nBrexit\\n our proceedings. There was a really good stat on Channel 5 on the weekend showing how little England have bowled on the stumps. Now, I know that this doesn?t necessarily translate to wanting to nick batsmen off when shaping away, but surely Philander?s proved ? like McGrath before him ? that there?s simple value in making the batsman play. It?s death by a thousand cuts, as Atherton, Hussain et al will tell you when it came to the Ashes. Tall bowlers are all well and good but if you?ll never hit the stumps, where?s the pressure? Someone pass me the gin.?Agree with a lot of this, but Morkel has been great so far this series. The difference in this match - in mine - has been the batting more than the bowling. \\n\\n1.30pm BST\\n13:30\\n\\nWhat a morning for South Africa! Philander was brilliant first up, then Morris and Du Plessis added fresh impetus before the initial impetus had even expired. Sometime this afternoon, this match will end, you?d reckon - join me after lunch to ?enjoy? it.\\n\\n1.03pm BST\\n13:03\\n\\n28th over: England 79-4 (Bairstow 12, Stokes 5) Maharaj will bowl the final over before lunch, and he?s another who?s risen to the occasion - not just here, but at Lord?s. Bairstow uses his feet to take a single into the off side, which means three balls into the rough at Stokes - close by are two silly points. Stokes, though defends well enough, and thus ends another fantastic session for South Africa. Updated\\nat 1.29pm BST\\n\\n\\n12.59pm BST\\n12:59\\n\\n27th over: England 78-4 (Bairstow 11, Stokes 5) Stokes allows Martin to hit his face, running the ball through third man for four and reducing the target fro 400 and something to a far more manageable 300 and something. This is a fine spell from Morris, just when England might?ve thought themselves relative safe - his performance does not show Mark Wood in a favourable light. So, who comes in and who goes out for the Oval? I guess I?d keep Wood and Jennings but bin Dawson and Ballance. \\n\\n12.54pm BST\\n12:54\\n\\n26th over: England 74-4 (Bairstow 11, Stokes 1) Bairstow adds one with a sweep and then Stokes props forward tentatively, imparting an edge which cues strangulated shouts. Nasser points out that Stokes? gloves are very low, inviting the ball to run up them for a catch when he should be booting it away. Silly point comes in, and a shove towards mid on averts the additional embarrassment of a pair.  ?Not so long ago that Bairstow and Stokes added 399 against South Africa,? emails Peter Salmon; some of you might remember that he is in the pub. I?m not sure he?ll be getting served too many more.\\n\\n12.49pm BST\\n12:49\\n\\n25th over: England 72-4 (Bairstow 10, Stokes 0) Du Plessis has had a brilliant game here, from the moment he called correctly and was ballsy enough to bat. That bouncer was part of a plan he communicated to Morris last over, though the bowler did well to hold it back initially, then bowl it as quickly as he did. Wicket maiden. \\n\\n12.46pm BST\\n12:46\\n\\nWell done South Africa! They decide to go short at Cook, who opts to take it on. Then at the last second he tries to pull out, by which time the ball is in front of his helmet - it?s brilliantly straight. Cook succeeds only in swatting it down the leg side, where De Kock takes a superb catch. Expect England?s demise to accelerate from here. Updated\\nat 12.58pm BST\\n\\n\\n12.43pm BST\\n12:43\\n\\n24th over: England 72-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 10) Bairstow twists one away against the spin, and it zooms for four through square-leg. Then, though, spooked by that one which flew in Maharaj?s last over, Bairstow presses forward tentatively and inside-edges onto his pad. That did not look secure, but it did the trick. \\n\\n12.40pm BST\\n12:40\\n\\n23rd over: England 68-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 6) Root is now inside the dressing room and looking glum; on the bright side, perhaps Cook is playing his way into Test form, and as non-captain.

Maiden. \\n\\n12.35pm BST\\n12:35\\n\\n22nd over: England 68-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 6) When at the cricket, is it acceptable to drink fizz out of a pint glass? Asking for a friend, though at Lord?s last summer the kid in front cut out the middle man and just used the bottle. Maharaj is on and the ball is spinning, but without many close catchers; his final delivery pitches middle and leg, then pitches right across Bairstow! Dearie me! ?I prefer Rashid to Dawson too, but do find it telling that Root, who knows him well, would rather do without, emails Mark Gillespie, quoting me back to myself.?1. How do we know, or why do we assume, that Root is the sole arbiter of who plays and doesn?t? I always had the impression that the team selection was a joint effort between selectors, captain and coach, with the selectors having the biggest say.2. Is the reality not that it?s Moeen, not Dawson, who?s been picked over Rashid? My thinking behind that being that the balance of the team was meant to be a ?control? spinner plus a wicket taking spinner, and that neither Moeen nor Rashid could fulfill the former role? I?m clearly not suggesting that?s worked, by the way, but potentially that was the theory.?I?d say that in the end, the captain gets what he wants, because he?s the one taking the players onto the pitch and it?s pointless giving him a bowler he?d rather not bring on. Moeen is in the team for his batting anyway, no?\\n\\n12.31pm BST\\n12:31\\n\\n21st over: England 66-3 (Cook 41, Bairstow 5) Morris races in and Cook whacks him to square-leg - there?s a man there, so they only run one.

Anyway, Bairstow adds a further single. \\n\\n12.26pm BST\\n12:26\\n\\n20th over: England 64-3 (Cook 40, Bairstow 4) Cook plays for Olivier?s outswing, driving through cover; WinViz says South Africa are 100% likely to win this match. Cook takes a single and the field is pretty spread for Bairstow; that?s a little strange, given his score of 0 and the 406 more runs England need. Anyway, the first of those issues is quickly resolved via four down the ground. ?I?m not for dropping Ballance,? emails Gareth Fitzgerlad. You just know Andy Flower will demand James Vince get another chance...That being said ? why does Dawson need to be replaced by a spinner? Do we need four seamers and two spinners??I agree that six bowlers are too many, but just can?t see how Ballance is a Test number 3, nor why we need to expend more time investigating.

Presumably Maharaj will be on soon, and that will be the next test; in the meantime, Root turns away a single and Cook escapes by missing a pull entirely, while Holding complains that there are too many fielders saving runs and too few catchers.

Morris is on, bowling to two slips and gully - ?that looks a bit meagre to me,? says Mikey, far more melodically than I can type. root takes a single off the final ball of the over, playing it down into the off side and haring away. ?I think that bowling replacements are better,? emails Matthew Doherty, replying to Neil Harris. ?Rashid and Roland-Jones, with Woakes to return.?I prefer Rashid to Dawson too, but do find it telling that Root, who knows him well, wold rather do without.

Small victories, people, small victories. Meanwhile, back in the middle, Olivier gives Cook one on his pads - you know the rest. Or, to put it another way, the next phase of the innings is upon us, and England daren?t lose another wicket. So they add four more instead, Cook onto the front foot to drive down the ground.

Sorry, that?s all I?ve got; I take no responsibility for any dislocating shoulder.?How many changes is too many? asks Neil Harris. ?I reckon four are in serious danger of not playing the next test ?

Philander has bowled 6.3 overs, of which 33 deliveries have landed in line with the stumps; he now has the best average of any bowler with 50 or more Test wickets. Cook then waves slightly away from his body, but makes decent enough contact, earning four to third man before tucking a couple off his hip. Huge over for England, six from it.

Root defends confidently and grins at Morkel; ?what are you looking at, butthead,? comes back the reply.

Austen becomes the first female writer (following in the footsteps of William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens) to feature on a banknote.The note, launched by the Bank of England at Austen?s resting place, Winchester Cathedral, includes an image of the writer and one of her most beloved characters, Elizabeth Bennet. There are also illustrations of her writing table and her brother Edward Austen Knight?s home, Godmersham Park in Kent, thought to be a source of inspiration. But it is the quote that will raise eyebrows among Austen enthusiasts. At first glance the line from Pride and Prejudice ? ?I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!? ? seems a good choice. However, the words were spoken by one of Austen?s most deceitful characters, Caroline Bingley, who has no interest in books. She is sidling up to Mr Darcy, whom she would like as a husband. He is reading a book, so she sits next to him and pretends to read alongside him. Speaking at Winchester Cathedral, the Bank of England?s governor, Mark Carney, explained why Austen was chosen ? and the technical aspects of the notes.  He said: ?Our banknotes serve as repositories of the country?s collective memory, promoting awareness of the United Kingdom?s glorious history and highlighting the contributions of its greatest citizens. ?Austen?s novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published.? Turning to practical matters, he said: ?The new Â£10 will be printed on polymer, making it safer, stronger and cleaner. The note will also include a new tactile feature on the Â£10 to help the visually impaired, ensuring the nation?s money is as inclusive as possible.? It joins the Churchill Â£5 in the first family of polymer UK banknotes; a Â£20 note featuring JMW Turner will follow in 2020. The Â£10 note has security features that the Bank says make it very difficult to counterfeit. It is expected to last at least two-and-a-half times longer than paper Â£10 notes ? about five years in total.  The new tactile feature is a series of raised dots in the top left-hand corner, developed in conjunction with the RNIB, the charity that supports people with sight loss. This is in addition to the elements already incorporated in UK banknotes for visually impaired people: the tiered sizing, bold numerals, raised print and differing colour palettes.Austen fans will have to wait until later this year before they can begin to use the notes. They will be issued on 14 September and the public will begin to see them in the following days and weeks. The Bank hopes featuring Austen will help it counter accusations of sexism for not featuring more women on notes. The author follows Florence Nightingale and Elizabeth Fry in featuring on notes.Tuesday?s banknote launch is one of a series of events taking place to mark the 200th anniversary of Austen?s death, including the unveiling of a statue in Basingstoke, near her birthplace. Austen, who wrote keenly about money, might have been interested in research from Aviva claiming that the Â£10 pound note has a relative purchasing power of only 13p compared with what it could buy in 1817.', 'Karanbir Cheema, a 13-year-old boy fell ill while he was at his school in west London.

They have nuclear weapons and we want to have a relationship with them so that they dont look to China. I get all that. But are we doing anything different on sales to Pakistan to make sure those sales of whatever it is arent used against us directly or used against us indirectly because of the military helping the Taliban in Afghanistan where were have our troops and those weapons could be used against the United States?\" he asked. \"Are we doing anything different to make sure that doesnt happen or are we still using the same formula,\" Poe questioned. ', ' The Bombay high court on Monday directed the police to ensure that no minors are ?harmed, injured, or permitted to carry or use weapons or sharp objects,? during this year?s Muharram procession.The court said that while it was not oblivious to religious practices, a ?fine balance? needed to be maintained between such practices and ensuring the safety of all participants.The bench also directed the additional commissioner of police, south region, to ?personally supervise? the procession this September and ensure that the court?s directions are complied with.The court was hearing a suo moto public interest litigation over the participation of children in the mourning procession during Muharram.Shia Muslims, who participate in processions, hit themselves with sharp objects to mourn the death of Imam Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad.On the previous hearing, the bench had directed the police and state authorities to meet with the representatives of the community.The police said that the leaders of the community had said that this year, no child will be permitted to use or carry weapons during the procession. They had said that while children cannot be barred from participating in the procession, it will be ensured that ?they are not injured or harmed,? that they will ?not be permitted to inflict injuries upon themselves.?HC directed the Shia community to submit an undertaking in court stating this.', 'In the last few months, India?s pervasive culture of privilege has got a sound beating: In March, Ravindra Gaikwad, an MP, hit a 60-year-old Air India (AI) employee with a slipper and soon found himself on a ?no-fly? list. Then in April, the Cabinet banned red beacons on cars. And Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that there are no VIPs, every Indian is a very important person.On Wednesday, Air India (AI) scrapped one more privilege, this time an in-house one. Air India chairman and managing director Ashwani Lohani asked the staff to carry their hand baggage on their own and not use porters as has been the practice so far. Air India has a subsidiary called AI-SATS, a ground handling agency, which provides end-to-end services such as passenger and baggage handling. Apart from this, some people are reserved to assist VIPs and airline staff. They are called porters and carry the luggage of the ?VIP? passenger from the entry gate to the boarding point. But now only VIPs will continue to use the services of porters, the airline staff will be discouraged to use it. ?Even CMD will not use the porter service,? the airline said.While the move appreciable, the change is cosmetic. The move would have got a higher rating if this privilege was taken away from VIPs too. While such changes are fine and make for good optics, there are so many things that the AI needs to fix and, hopefully, those will also get adequate attention. Take for example, the airline?s rating and public perception. In January, flight data firm FlightStats marked AI as the third worst-performing airline in the world. The Portland-headquartered firm?s survey highlighted issues over cabins, service quality, and flight delays. Though Air India disagreed with the report, such reports do impact public perception and eventually bookings. It is important to manage perceptions and AI has to invest time, effort and money into it apart from doing away with perks and privileges extended to staff.  Then its finances. As a columnist pointed out last week, the organisation has consistently incurred losses and is severely debt-ridden despite equity infusion of around Rs 25,000 crore since 2012. More damaging was the Comptroller and Auditor General?s performance audit report of the airline, which was tabled in Parliament in March. The report said inefficiencies in the company may mean that a lot more of public money will be needed to keep the Maharaja afloat.

A public vote to name four trains running between the Swedish cities of Stockholm and Gothenburg has resulted in one of the four being called Trainy McTrainface in an echo of the name chosen by the British public for the new polar research vessel.Trainy McTrainface received 49% of the votes in a poll, jointly run by Swedish rail company MTR Express and Swedish newspaper Metro.That placed it well ahead the other three options: Hakan, Miriam and Poseidon.The other trains have already been named by the public: one is named Estelle, after the five-year-old daughter of Sweden?s Princess Victoria, the next in line to the Swedish throne.Another is named Glenn, after a long-running joke that everyone in Gothenburg is called Glenn. The joke has a basis in fact: the name is particularly common in the city and its surrounding area, with its popularity stemming from the 1980s, when local football team IFK GÃ¶teborg had four players all called Glenn in its lineup. Forty-three per cent of voters supported the name Glenn.The fourth train has yet to be named. A fifth train, Ingvar, after the Swedish TV personality Ingvar Oldsberg, was named before voting began.The public vote was eventually overruled in the case of Boaty McBoatface and the ship named the RRS Sir David Attenborough, with an onboard submersible receiving the Boatface appellation.MTR Express said the McBoatface decision had led to disappointment worldwide and it hoped the name Trainy McTrainface would ?be received with joy by many, not only in Sweden?.', 'Mumbai, Feb 17 (PTI) Aditya Puri, Managing Director and Chief Executive of the second largest private lender HDFC Bank, today backed the idea of setting up a national bad bank, saying anything that can help resolve the perennial bad loans problem is welcome. \"I dont think a national bad bank is a bad idea. The Government and the regulators are coming up with various discussions as to how solve the issue relating to NPAs and that is necessary so that the banking system has the ability to do more. \"Bad bank is one of the ideas being discussed, there are other ideas like the Bankruptcy Code which should also help, we bankers are also working (on tacking NPA issue),\" Puri told a panel discussion at the concluding day of the three-day annual Nasscom leadership forum here. It can be noted that almost 20 per cent of the banking assets are stressed with the NPAs alone topping 13.5 per cent as of the September quarter. While more than 70 per cent of the system are with the state-run banks, over 90 per cent of the stressed assets with them, leaving them starved of growth capital. While its banks are starved of cash, the Government finances are not adequate to recapitalise them which was visible from the paltry Rs 10,000 crore for capital infusion into 24 state-run banks in the Budget 2018. In fiscal 2017 and the previous year, the Government infused Rs 25,000 crore each in to these banks, while their demand is at least Rs 91,000 crore between the next two fiscal years, as per an India Ratings estimate in the core tier I capital alone to meet the stringent Basel 3 capital norms. For the system as a whole between fiscal 2015 and 2019, the banks need more than Rs 3.9 trillion for the banks to meet the Basel III capital norms. Of this Rs 1.8 trillion are only tier I core capital for the public sector banks.

Researchers, including those from Temple University in the US, build on their previous study in which they used transgenic rat and mouse models with HIV-1 DNA incorporated into the genome of every tissue of the animals bodies. They demonstrated that their strategy could delete the targeted fragments of HIV-1 from the genome in most tissues in the experimental animals. The researchers genetically inactivated HIV-1 in transgenic mice, reducing the RNA expression of viral genes by roughly 60 to 95 per cent. They then tested their system in mice acutely infected with EcoHIV, the mouse equivalent of human HIV-1. In the third animal model, latent HIV-1 infection was recapitulated in humanised mice engrafted with human immune cells, including T cells, followed by HIV-1 infection. In all three animal models, the researchers utilised a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector delivery system based on a subtype known as AAV-DJ/8. \"The AAV-DJ/8 subtype combines multiple serotypes, giving us a broader range of cell targets for the delivery of our CRISPR/Cas9 system,\" said Wenhui Hu, associate professor at Temple University. Researchers also re-engineered their previous gene editing apparatus to carry a set of four guide RNAs, all designed to efficiently excise integrated HIV-1 DNA from the host cell genome and avoid potential HIV-1 mutational escape. ', 'US?President Donald Trump on Saturday attacked The New York Times and its ?sick agenda,? alleging that one of the paper?s reports thwarted a US bid to take out Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.?The Failing New York Times foiled US attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist, Al-Baghdadi. Their sick agenda over National Security,? Trump wrote in one of a barrage of early morning tweets.Trump did not expand on his charge against The Times, or explain what revelation by the daily is supposed to have hampered Baghdadi?s capture. The New York Times told the Politico news site in a statement: ?We have asked the White House to clarify the tweet.?US media suggested that Trump may have been referring to a Fox News report about comments made by a top general at a security conference on Friday in Aspen, Colorado.At that gathering, General Tony Thomas -- head of the US military?s Special Operations Command -- reportedly said that American forces at one point came ?particularly close? to Baghdadi after a 2015 raid recovered information about the Islamic State group.Fox News reported that Thomas said US troops had ?a very good lead,? on the IS leader?s whereabouts. ?Unfortunately, it was leaked in a prominent national newspaper about a week later and that lead went dead,? Thomas reportedly said at the forum.US Secretary of Defence James Mattis said Friday that he believes Baghdadi is still alive, following various claims in recent months that he has been killed.?We are going after him, but we assume he is alive,? the Pentagon chief said.There have been persistent rumors that Baghdadi has died in recent months.With a $25 million US bounty on his head, Baghdadi has kept a low profile but is rumored to move regularly throughout IS-held territory in Iraq and Syria.The Iraqi -- nicknamed ?The Ghost? -- has not been seen since making his only known public appearance as ?caliph? in 2014 at the Grand Mosque of Al-Nuri in Mosul, which was destroyed in the battle for Iraq?s second city.The Times has become a favorite Trump target despite his penchant for reaching out to the daily, including this week, when he gave its reporters a major interview in which he criticized his own Attorney General Jeff Sessions.In Saturday?s tweetstorm, Trump railed against The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for its ?illegal leaks.??A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post, this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions,? he wrote on Twitter, adding ?These illegal leaks... must stop!?He also groused about some of his favorite targets: the failure of US lawmakers to repeal ?dead?

The court also imposed a penalty on convict Saurabh Kapoor, 35, who was convicted of rape under Section 376 of the IPC.Additional Sessions Judge Rajni Yadav, while pronouncing the quantum of sentence, said that given the inhumanity of the act, it was required to impose upon the convict substantive and stern sentence that would commensurate with the gravity of the offence and also serve as an example to others.It is to be noted that since both the victim and the accused were blind, the court had relied upon ?voice identification? that helped the woman to identify Kapoor, a resident of Mayur Vihar in Delhi.On the pretext of meeting an advocate, Kapoor had taken the victim on May 30, 2015, to a guest house in Gurgaon and raped her there for the first time. He later continued to abuse her, promising marriage.The victim, who has an eight-year-old daughter, worked in a private company in 2015, when the incident happened. She is currently unemployed.Public prosecutor Arvind Sharma said that the convict tried to seek leniency from the court on account of his blindness.?The accused also argued that he is a government servant and highly qualified, but all these arguments were rejected by the court, which awarded him 10 years of imprisonment,? said Sharma, adding that the court has imposed a penalty of Rs 10,000, out of which Rs 8,000 would go to the victim. The remaining Rs 2000 would go to the state. If the accused fail to pay the fine, he will face one more year of imprisonment.The judge, in her order, also stated that undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence to the accused would do more harm as it will undermine the public confidence.?Keeping in view the offence committed by the convict, I am not inclined to take a lenient view against him and release him on probation. He has raped a young woman who was helpless, defenceless, vulnerable and an easy prey who trusted the convict so much that she surrendered herself to him. He used, violated and exploited her body,? the court said.District attorney Lal Singh Yadav said the court has given a strong message to the society. ?The convict had sexually exploited the victim on the pretext of marriage,? he said.', 'Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, responding to the Alwar gau rakshak attack, said that no such incident, as was reported by the media, took place.

The group behind the initiative is also developing a mobile phone app - Rescue Me - which hotel staff can use to alert local police and senior anti-trafficking officers if they see suspicious behavior. \"Hotels are breeding grounds for human trade,\" said Sanee Awsarmmel, chairman of the alumni group of Maharashtra State Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology. \"(We) have hospitality professionals working in hotels across the country. We are committed to this cause.\"The initiative, spearheaded by the alumni group and backed by the Maharashtra state government, comes amid growing international recognition that hotels have a key role to play in fighting modern day slavery. MAHARASHTRA MAJOR DESTINATION FOR TRAFFICKED GIRLS Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, is a major destination for trafficked girls who are lured from poor states and nearby countries on the promise of jobs, but then sold into the sex trade or domestic servitude. With rising property prices, some traditional red light districts like those in Mumbai have started to disappear pushing the sex trade underground into private lodges and hotels, which makes it hard for police to monitor.Awsarmmel said hotels would be told about 50 signs that staff needed to watch out for.These include requests for rooms with a view of the car park which are favored by traffickers as they allow them to vet clients for signs of trouble and check out their cars to gauge how much to charge.Awsarmmel said hotel staff often noticed strange behavior such as a girl\\'s reticence during the check-in process or her dependence on the person accompanying her to answer questions and provide her proof of identity.But in most cases, staff ignore these signs or have no idea what to do, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.RESCUE ME APP The Rescue Me app - to be launched in a couple of months - will have a text feature where hotel staff can fill in details including room numbers to send an alert to police.Human trafficking is the world\\'s fastest growing criminal enterprise worth an estimated $150 billion a year, according to the International Labor Organization, which says nearly 21 million people globally are victims of forced labor and trafficking.Last year, major hotel groups, including the Hilton and Shiva Hotels, pledged to examine their supply chains for forced labor, and train staff how to spot and report signs of trafficking.Earlier this year, Mexico City also launched an initiative to train hotel staff about trafficking.Vijaya Rahatkar, chairwoman of the Maharashtra State Women\\'s Commission, said the initiative would have an impact beyond the state as the alumni group had contact with about a million small hotels across India.The group is also developing a training module on trafficking for hotel staff and hospitality students which could be used across the country.ALSO READFYI | Legal revenge: Child sex trafficking survivors get \\'School of Justice\\' to fight their own battlesMumbai: Woman DJ arrested in high-profile sex racket case', 'As India women get ready to face hosts and favourite England in the final of the Women\\'s World Cup at Lord\\'s, former captain MS Dhoni has sent his advice and wishes for the Women in Blue.India women have reached the final of the World Cup for the second time -- the first being in 2005 where they were overhwhelmed by Australia by 98 runs.MS Dhoni has led Team India 2011 World Cup triumph, T20 World Cup win and the 2013 Champions Trophy victory.2011 WORLD CUPIn the 2011 World Cup as well, India had defeated Australia in the quarter-final just like the 1983 World Cup and then went on to win the trophy.At the Wankhede Stadium in the final, Sri Lanka won the toss, opted to bat first and posted a good 274 runs for India to chase.Gautam Gambhir and MS Dhoni steered India\\'s chase as the former scored 97 runs off 115 balls and the Captain Cool promoted himself up the order and played a match-winning knock of 91 in 79 balls to give India their second World Cup.MS Dhoni\\'s calm yet explosive innings at the fag end of the match still remains a strong memory in the minds of all Indian cricket fans.2007 T20 WORLD CUPOpting to bat first, Gautam Gambhir held the strings and scored a solid 75-run innings at the top to guide India to a decent total of 157 runs.Pakistan\\'s batting order held their stitches together and Misbah-ul-Haq\\'s 43 from 38 balls was crucial to take Pakistan close.But Dhoni\\'s call to give Joginder Sharma the last over proved to the masterstroke that gave India a 5-run victory and the Men in Blue scooped the first T20 World Cup and their first ICC trophy under Dhoni.2013 CHAMPIONS TROPHYIndia were on a rampage in the 2013 Champions Trophy in England.

It is believed that by 2030, LEDs will account for 75 per cent of all lighting sales around the world. RAJIV GANDHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTThe Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) at Hyderabad will soon become 100 per cent LED-lit airport. The authorities are already done with 75 per cent work on the project.The GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd (GHIAL), which operates the airport, announced on Tuesday that it has converted the entire taxiway edge lights from halogen lamps to LEDs which are highly efficient as compared to halogen lights.LEDs also have a much smaller environmental impact than incandescent bulbs. Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) thus became south India's first and India's second airport to achieve going all LED.HYDERABAD'S CARBON NEUTRAL AIRPORTComplementing the recently achieved recognition of being carbon neutral airport, GHIAL is marching to transform the RGIA into a 100 per cent LED airport, and 75 per cent work on this has already been completed, GHIAL said in a statement.LEDs can also last more than 25 times longer than the traditional light bulbs cutting down costs further.RGIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTENANCEThe RGIA, which currently serves more than 15 million passengers per annum (MPPA) with close to 400 daily air traffic movements, has a mission to move from conventional energy to renewable energy sources for environmental sustenance. It recently commissioned a captive 5MW Solar Power Plant for its use supporting sustainable energy.UNDERGOING LED TRANSFORMATIONThe busiest and the most critical area of the airport -- the airside -- has undergone LED transformation. As many as 500 halogen lamps of taxiway edge lights were converted to LEDs. All LEDs at taxiway edge lights cover around 26 km of the area in the airside.Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport has more than 26,000 conventional lamps. More than 19,500 have been converted into LED.The switch to LED lights has amounted to a saving of 2.2 million unites of electricity per annum.\", 'The United States has accused China and Russia of bearing ?unique and special responsibility? for North Korea?s ?belligerent? pursuit of nuclear weapons, after Pyongyang tested its latest ballistic missile.North Korea conducted its second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test late on Friday in what it called a warning to the ?beast-like US imperialists?. It came less than a month after its first such experiment, on 4 July.The test-launch sent ?a grave warning to the US? that it ?would not go scot-free if it dares provoke? the North, Pyongyang?s official news agency, KCNA, said in a statement. ?If the Yankees brandish the nuclear stick on this land again despite our repeated warnings, we will clearly teach them manners,? KCNA warned.The news agency described Pyongyang?s weapons programs as a ?precious strategic asset that cannot be bartered for anything? and an indication of the country?s ?tremendous might?.The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, hit back on Saturday, describing North Korea?s launch as a ?blatant violation? of multiple UN security council resolutions.Tillerson also pointed the finger of blame at Beijing and Moscow. ?As the principal economic enablers of North Korea?s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development program, China and Russia bear unique and special responsibility for this growing threat to regional and global stability,? he said in a statement. Tillerson?s comments are sure to anger Russia and China. Earlier this month Beijing rejected claims from US president Donald Trump that it had a responsibility to do more to rein in its ally. ?I think this either shows lack of a full, correct knowledge of the issue, or there are ulterior motives for it, trying to shift responsibility,? Geng Shuang, a foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters.On Saturday, China?s foreign ministry made no reference to Tillerson?s comments but called on Pyongyang ?to respect United Nations security council resolutions and stop all acts that could worsen tensions on the Korean peninsula?. China also ?urged all the relevant parties to act with caution? to prevent the situation from escalating, the ministry added, parroting previous language on the issue. Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) thinktank in Washington, said Kim Jong-un?s latest test ? of a missile some experts said had the capacity to reach New York ? would increase Chinese fears of a US strike against the North. ?I suspect that the Chinese are going to be worried about the possibility of a US military strike on North Korea going forward ? The Chinese can?t rule out the Trump ?unpredictability? factor,? she said.Last week the US?s top military officer told a security forum in Aspen, Colorado that conflict with North Korea was not ?unimaginable?. ?What?s unimaginable to me is allowing a capability that would allow a nuclear weapon to land in Denver, Colorado ? that?s unimaginable to me. And so my job will be to develop military options to make sure that doesn?t happen,? said Gen Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.Glaser said it was hard to predict whether Trump?s White House was genuinely pondering such military options, which might include attempting to destroy a North Korean missile on the launch pad before it it was fired. But following Friday?s test, calls for a return to negotiations appeared increasingly unrealistic. ?Diplomacy seems very unlikely at present.?Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea specialist at the Middlebury institute of international studies, said he believed a military strike against North Korea had become unthinkable in the light of the ICBM tests, which showed Pyongyang could hit targets on US soil by launching missiles from unexpected locations and at unexpected times. ?The North Koreans wanted to demonstrate that ... if there was a war they could definitely launch [missiles] in the dead of night from some place we don?t expect so we wouldn?t have a chance to fire at them before they got off the ground.??What I think this changes is that it forces the US to confront something that we have said for a long-time is unacceptable ? [that] they can target New York and LA and there is not much we can do about it.??The window for [military action] has closed. People are jumping up and down and screaming [in Washington] not because they are getting ready to attack but because they don?t really have that option any more and they accept that it has gone,? Lewis added. ?Attacking a nuclear-armed state is usually a bad idea - which is why countries build nuclear weapons. That is kind of the appeal.?', 'New Delhi, Feb 13 (PTI) Shares of Ruchi Soya Industries today surged over 17 per cent after the company signed an agreement with Patanjali Ayurved for physical refining and packaging of edible oils.

Asking the authorities to find out about the burial practices prevailing elsewhere in the world, a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said as the population was rising, the death rate was also growing, but the land remained the same. \"The way you are expanding graves, there will be no place to live. There is no place for people to live. There is space only for graves. Please help the city to live. Where will you bury people who die now? Find out what is the practice in the world,\" the bench said. It also said that several illegal activities were also going on in the graveyards. The observations came as the bench heard pleas related to unauthorised construction inside the Amir Khusro Park near Sundar Nagar in South Delhi. When the counsel for Waqf Board said the population of Muslims has grown by 1.2 per cent in last 10 years, the bench shot back \"has the land grown in that proportion? It remains the same.\" \"Already Christian cemeteries are facing a problem. You say population is increasing, ... Do you have the land to bury people now. Hindus have started opting for electric cremation as there may not be enough trees to get wood for cremation. What can be the substitute for Muslims,\" it observed. During the hearing, the bench also asked the Waqf Board counsel to go and inspect the structures at the park and inform it which of these were pre-existing and which ones were new. \"We will protect only the old structures. New structures are not liable to be protected. We are here to see that the law is abided by,\" it said and listed the matter for further hearing on July 10. The bench also asked the authorities to remove debris from the demolished structures in the park.

A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli told the two respondents that they cannot be permitted to keep stray dogs in the common driveway of a private property which was jointly owned by others, if their neighbours did not approve. The court also said in a recent order that the two cannot feed the dogs or chain them in the driveway. The bench said it was the duty of the two \"to ensure that the stray dogs do not cause any nuisance to the other residents within the same property and in the neighbourhood\". The court noted that keeping stray dogs would \"cause fear and discomfort\" to others living or coming there \"who are not accustomed to keeping pet dogs\". \"The nuisance caused by the conduct of respondent nos.3 and 4 (the two individual respondents) in sheltering the stray dogs in the common driveway in the present case is writ large from the photographs placed on record. \"To a person, who is not accustomed to keeping pet dogs, it also causes fear and discomfort to walk into a property where stray dogs are kept either chained or let loose,\" it said. The bench said it \"rues the lack of civic sense and concern exhibited\" by the two towards their fellow inhabitants in their immediate neighbourhood. \"Their concern for the stray dogs also appears to us to be superficial and lacks commitment. Otherwise, the dogs would not have been left in such unhygienic and filthy conditions, as appear from the photographs on record,\" the bench said. It directed them to \"stop chaining, feeding or sheltering the stray dogs in the driveway of the aforesaid property. It shall also be the obligation of respondent nos.3 and 4 to ensure that the said dogs do not defecate in the driveway, and if they do so, it shall be their responsibility to clean up the same.\" It directed the Station House Officer of Malviya Nagar police station, under whose jurisdiction the property fell, to ensure strict compliance of this order. The order came on the plea by one Om Prakash Saini, who jointly holds the property with the two respondents, claiming that keeping and feeding the stray dogs in the common driveway was \"causing immense nuisance and harassment for the other residents\". The court has listed the matter for further hearing on September 1. The order comes in the backdrop of a January order of the Supreme Court which categorically said \"stray dogs have a right to live.\" During that hearing, the apex court had reacted sharply when a submission was made that such canines should be completely eliminated across the country.

Vettel, Raikkonen and Hamilton remain only two seconds apart. Raikkonen has stepped off a little, conscious that he is going to wear out his tyres if he keeps trying to close down his team-mate. Hamilton is struggling to get any closer to the Ferraris, though, despite the aid of DRS. \\n\\n2.23pm BST\\n14:23\\n\\nLap 55/70 The Ferraris are approaching the backmarkers of Magnussen and Hulkenberg, who themselves are scrapping for 11th. They move through the traffic in one of the trickiest parts of the track, the third and final sector approaching the long pitstraight. As Vettel crosses the line he?s only 0.7 seconds ahead of Raikkonen, who is 0.7 seconds up on Hamilton. Bottas can?t keep up right now. \\n\\n2.20pm BST\\n14:20\\n\\nLap 53/70 Hamilton is chasing Raikkonen, but the Fin is lining up a pass of his own as he attacks Vettel, who continues to struggle a little.

Smoke appears to be billowing from his front left tyre, and as he pulls away he seems very unsure of whether his car is still road-worthy. Up ahead, Hamilton is attacking Raikkonen ? he?s 1.1 seconds down. Raikkonen is 1.1 seconds behind Vettel as it bunches up at the front. Raikkonen is continuing to complain on radio that he should be allowed to pass his team-mate. ?Vettel is being told to push, stay with him,? respond Ferrari. \\n\\n2.11pm BST\\n14:11\\n\\nLap 47/70 Mercedes give the order and Valtteri Bottas pulls wide to allow Hamilton to pass.

Vettel is struggling and behind him Raikkonen is putting in quick times. Raikkonen wants to be let through to have a go at winning this race, but Vettel is their only championship hope and they don?t want to leave him vulnerable to the two Mercedes chasing.

He?ll be in shortly. \\n\\n1.58pm BST\\n13:58\\n\\nLap 37/70 Sergio Perez brings that garish Force India into the pits but it?s a pretty poor one and he?s lost some time. Next Alonso is in. He is desperate to get in and out ahead of Sainz, almost colliding with his young Spanish counterpart on exit. A battle ensues as they emerge on to the circuit but Sainz holds on to ninth spot, Alonso running off and on again in his eagerness to pass. \\n\\n1.54pm BST\\n13:54\\n\\nLap 34/70 Vettel?s pit stop is a little sluggish. Next comes Raikkonen. First he sounds off over radio, telling backmarker Paul di Resta to ?get back in the commentary box?.

He returns fifth, such was the huge gap to Carlos Sainz before he came in. \\n\\n1.49pm BST\\n13:49\\n\\nLap 31/70 Despite the issue with his steering wheel, Vettel seems comfortable enough to continue leading the way, though Raikkonen has closed that gap down from nearly two seconds.

The supersoft tyre (which most drivers have started with) is significantly quicker than the soft around the Hungaroring, though it doesn?t last nearly as long. There could well be some undercut opportunities here. Meanwhile: ?The steering is hanging to the left when I go straight,? complains Sebastian Vettel. ?And I think it?s getting worse.?\\n\\n1.40pm BST\\n13:40\\n\\nLap 24/70 Grosjean?s race is over. He can?t get his crawling car back to the pits and he pulls up to become the second retirement of this race. \\n\\n1.39pm BST\\n13:39\\n\\nLap 23/70 Well it should have been a long stint. ?OK slow down, bring it back,? Haas say on radio. ?I think we have a crossed wheel nut.?

He puts on the soft tyre which will set him up for a long stint. \\n\\n1.33pm BST\\n13:33\\n\\nLap 20/70 Hulkenberg has been given a free pass by Jolyon Palmer, his Renault team-mate. The Briton started 10th but has slipped back to 12th. \\n\\n1.31pm BST\\n13:31\\n\\nLap 19/70 Hamilton, in fifth, has upped his pace in the past couple of laps, setting the fastest opening sector of the race and opening a gap between his Mercedes and the Toro Rosso of Sainz behind him of around 12 seconds ? the biggest in the race.

I saw I had a good run out of one, I thought I?ll just go here and protect that place, and felt it hit. For sure it?s not on, that was amateur to say the least. I don?t think he likes when a team-mate gets in front of him. It was a very poor mistake. For sure, we?ll sort it out. I don?t think there?s an excuse for it. He got the line taken away from, he sees me go past, and it?s like ?I?ve got to fix this? and that?s it.?\\n\\n1.26pm BST\\n13:26\\n\\nLap 14/70 Grosjean and Hulkenberg?s bump, a moment I haven?t seen much of, has been dismissed by the stewards as a racing incident.

The safety car comes in, and Vettel zips away with Raikkonen on his tail. Hamilton attacks Verstappen and they?re wheel to wheel through the first few corners, but the teenager won?t yield!\\n\\n1.11pm BST\\n13:11\\n\\nLap 4/70 The safety car is out and leading Vettel round the Hungaroring, followed by Raikkonen, Bottas, Verstappen, Hamilton, Sainz, Alonso, Perez, Vandoorne, and Ocon in 10th. \\n\\n1.09pm BST\\n13:09\\n\\nLap 2/70 Yellow flags as Ricciardo?s car is dealt with. The replay shows Hamilton try to hold the inside line on the tight turn one and get swamped by both Red Bulls, but on turn two Verstappen seems to lock up slightly, slamming into the side of his team-mate.

Baba aka Sudhir Makkar is well known throughout the 200km yatra route from Hardwar to Delhi.The addition of the chain has taken Baba?s gold ornaments to about 14.5kgs which include a collection of 21 gold chains, 21 lockets of deities, armlets and even a gold jacket which he wears sometimes during the yatra sitting atop his SUV which is one among the cavalcade of 16 vehicles that accompany him.?The new chain weighs two kgs and has a locket of Shiva. I am not wearing much gold on this journey as its weight has affected my nerves at the neck and also affected vision of one eye. This is my penultimate Kanwar Yatra and 2018 will be last ending with a silver jubilee,? Baba said.Apart from his fetish for gold, Baba also wears a Rolex watch worth Rs 27 lakh and owns a BMW, three Fortuners, two Audi and two Innova vehicles which are part of his cavalcade. On several occasions, he has taken cars such as Hummer, Jaguar and Land Rover on rent for his trip to Haridwar.?The love for gold and cars will not die. I remember it was in 1972-73 when gold price was Rs 200 per tola (10 grams). I started wearing gold items and had nearly four tolas that time. Gradually, the gold increased. I will keep the gold with me till I die. It will be handed over to my favourite disciple when I leave the world,? said the 55-year-old.Before moving to spiritualism, Makkar ran a successful cloth and property business from the Gandhi Nagar market in Delhi. He now has a luxurious flat at a high-rise in Indirapuram, Ghaziabad.The initial years of life were, however, difficult for him. He went to a gurukul at the age of six and went to Haridwar in search of livelihood. He sold rosary beads and cloth on pavements.?Later, my business flourished with the grace of lord Shiva. I sold jeans, shirts and jackets with the brand name Bittu. Even the property business flourished as I got completely devoted to Shiva,? he said.These days Baba travels along with a team of 18 bouncers and eight security officers who keep an eye on his gold while he is on the move. Popular also as Shri Mahant Ji Golden Puri Babaji, Makkar said that he still has a lot of property in Delhi. His disciples estimate that Baba, who has no children, owns property worth over Rs 150 crore.Baba is a popular figure in the annual pilgrimage. Children, women and youngster wait eagerly for his cavalcade to arrive on erstwhile NH-58. They make his videos, click selfies with him and even touch his feet for blessings.?It is out of affection that everyone loves me, more so as I wear gold. Throughout the route, people from all communities, including Muslims, shower love on me and cheer me up,? he said.His participation, however, keeps the local police officers on toes.?He often stops midway and we have to rush to make arrangements for his security. It is tough as he has a large number of cars and other vehicles in his cavalcade.

It was such a large mass. All the 17 contact lenses were stuck together. We were really surprised that the patient did not notice it because it would cause quite a lot of irritation while it was sitting there,\" Rupal Morjaria, a specialist trainee ophthalmologist who dealt with the case at Solihull Hospital near Birmingham, said.Initially, eye specialists discovered 17 lenses, before a further examination disclosed that another 10 lenses were stuck in the eye.The patient said she had been wearing monthly disposable contact lenses for 35 years but did not attend regular appointments.As a result of the findings, the woman, who said she was unaware that the lenses were missing, had her operation postponed as the risk of developing endophthalmitis, inflammation of the interior of the eye, was increased.\"She was quite shocked. When she was seen two weeks after I removed the lenses she said her eyes felt a lot more comfortable,\" Morjaria said.', 'Kirti Kulhari expressed her disappointment over Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for making 12 cuts and adding two disclaimers in her forthcoming film Indu Sarkar.

I don\\'t know, but it has become like a process where every film needs to go through and I think you should watch the film with reference to the context. Censor board needs to grow up and let the audiences grow up,\" she said. The censor board asked Madhur Bhandarkar, the director of Indu Sarkar, to remove words like RSS and Akali from the film. The filmmaker, who doesn\\'t wish to make the changes as he fears the essence of the film will get affected, was flummoxed by CBFC\\'s decision.Kirti along with filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar, veteran singer-composer Bappi Lahiri and Miss India Tourism Ishika Taneja was in the capital to launch the film\\'s new song Dilli Ki Raat.\"After Pink, I wanted to do something with which people will get surprised again so Indu Sarkar seemed as the perfect fit as it has Emergency as its backdrop. It\\'s a very important subject. The title role that I played was very challenging and interesting,\" Kirti said.Controversies over Indu Sarkar have ranged from reactions against the CBFC, backlash against Bhandarkar after a Congress representative announced prize money for any person who can blacken the filmmaker\\'s face, to politicians demanding exclusive screenings of the film ahead of censor certification for approvals.About the row, Kirti said: \"I will be lying if I say that it (controversies surrounding Indu Sarkar\\') doesn\\'t bother me. Initially I was like, it\\'s fine. But now daily something or the other is happening, especially I am most concerned about the censor board because if we do what they have asked for, then the whole essence of the film goes.\"Indu Sarkar, also featuring Neil Nitin Mukesh and Anupam Kher, is slated to release on July 28.', ' Soon Mumbaiites will be able to dine on the sea with the iconic cable-stayed Bandra Worli Sea Link in the back drop.

The government has decided to take up a pilot project in these cities and later extend it across the state based on the response. The state public works department will test the project, dubbed ?streets with cycle tracks? in Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Amravati, Chandrapur, Kolhapur, Solapur, Latur, Aurangabad and Jalgaon, on roads under the department?s jurisdiction. The government has also formed a four-member committee under the chairmanship of the state?s additional director general of police, traffic, to steer the project. The committee will identify arterial roads where cycle tracks can be set up depending on the availability of space and the scope for cycling. It will also have to design the routes for these tracks and plan any other requirements or alterations to the traffic flow on the roads hosting the cycle tracks, an official from the state public works department said.Read: Is Mumbai ready for cycle tracks? Bandra tells a different storyHe said, ?Currently, there is a lack of any infrastructure for cyclists. A number of these cities have industrial areas where labourers come to work from a distance of nearly 7-8km. If we better equip our roads, even they can use bicycles to commute to their workplaces. It will not only reduce traffic, but will also considerably lessen environmental pollution.?Some of the previous efforts at creating cycling tracks and promoting bicycles have failed miserably owing to lack of proper planning and maintenance. Most cycling tracks of the 123-km network in Pune that the civic body created under the erstwhile Congress-led government?s Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission are in a bad shape. Similarly, a 13-km cycling track, costing Rs6.5 crore, in Mumbai?s Bandra Kurla Complex had absolutely no takers and had to be dismantled within five years.The state?s proposed urban transport policy, its first attempt at listing out goals for sustainable non-motorised transport, also lays emphasis on development of cycling as one of the main modes of commuting. It calls for planning and prioritising projects to make 80% of all trips in a city possible by walking, cycling or public transport.The civic bodies of some of the cities that the state government has picked in its pilot project have also been planning cycling projects. The Nashik Municipal Corporation has made a provision in its development plan to build 120km of cycling tracks in the city, while the Nagpur civic body is mulling over a public bicycle sharing system.

You can just sit back and relax now as the registration certificate (RC) for your car will soon be delivered right at your doorstep.Starting next week, the Delhi government is going to put in place a new system in which RCs will be delivered at the vehicle owners? residence via speed post. At present, people have to visit either the dealers? showrooms or the Motor Licensing Offices (MLOs) to get the mandatory document that establishes the ownership of a vehicle and ensures that it is part of the count kept by the transport department of a state. With the new system in place, once the dealers or buyers deposit documents with the MLOs the registration certificates will be directly sent by post to car owners. The move assumes significance as over 10 lakh RCs are issued in the national Capital annually. Of this, nearly seven lakh are issued against new cars and 2.1 lakh are those under ?transfer of ownership? or on resale of used cars. Besides, approximately 55000 additional RCs issued under the ?duplicate? category for those who have lost the document.\\\\According to officials in the transport department the new system will not only make things easier for the vehicle owner, but is aimed at eliminating corruption as well. ?We were getting feedback that some licensing officers have been engaging in corrupt practices with the car or bike dealers. This system would remove the contact between the dealers and the licensing officers as all documents will collectively reach for dispatch and there shall be no preference given to anybody,? a transport official said.Vehicle owners will also get alerts through SMS about the status of their RC.

Many of them said it would be much easier for them to receive the RC at home. However, some had doubts about how much time the delivery would take. ?What if the parcel gets lost in transit?

So, to that extent, those things have been put on the same platform,\" Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya told reporters here today. Effective April 1, the five associate banks -- State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Travancore -- as well as Bharatiya Mahila Bank have been merged with SBI, creating a global banking behemoth. She said the bank has undertaken an asset quality review (AQR) on its own, apart from the one mandated by the Reserve Bank in December 2015, in respect of all the common accounts as part of the merger process. \"All the stressed assets to the extent possible, where we had common exposures, are aligned now. We had taken more than Rs 8,600 crore of additional provisions,\" she added. \"We believe that even though numbers look bigger, we now have much better ability to resolve them as the day we resolve our NPAs, those will also get resolved. So, there will be much more control on resolution going forward.\" It can be noted that while SBI contained its bad loans in the December quarter most of the five associates saw the same soaring. While gross NPA of SBI rose to 7.23 per cent in the December quarter from 5.10 per cent a year ago, its net NPA firmed up to 4.24 per cent from 2.89 per cent. But State Bank of Mysore saw its gross NPA soaring to 14.46 per cent and net NPA to 9.22 per cent while SBBJs gross NPA rose to 11.19 per cent and net NPA to 8.26 per cent. As for SBT, its gross NPA jumped to 12.22 per cent and net NPA to 8.03 per cent. SBHs net NPA more than trebled to 8.03 per cent from 2.46 per cent a year earlier. Bhattacharya said SBI has created a CBS database of about 500 tera byte, which is likely to be the biggest Oracle database in the world. \"Weve accomplished it in the past 48 hours. I dont think anybody in the world would have attempted and completed such a mass mission, a six-way merger of such a magnitude,\" she said. Post-merger, SBI will join the league of top 50 banks globally in terms of assets worth Rs 37 trillion and customer base of 370 million. She said the focus in the first quarter will be more on consolidation, which is expected to be over by May 27, and the branch rationalisation will start from the second quarter onwards. \"Once audits are completed, from April 24 onwards, every weekend, data of one bank to be merged will be taken and will be merged with SBI,\" she said. \"So, within May 27, the entire granular level data merger will be completed,\" she said further, adding that in the case of Bharatiya Mahila Bank and the treasury, the granular data merger has already been completed. Talking about the voluntary retirement scheme introduced for employees of five associate banks, Bhattacharya said that out of the 12,500 eligible staffers, 2,800 have already opted for the scheme that closes on April 5. She claimed that the merger will benefit associate banks customers in terms of lower interest rates and an additional bouquet of products and services. \"As a result of merger, borrowers can expect lower interest rates at renewal or at time of origination of the loan,\" the chairman said.

The three internet providers, China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, are all state-owned.China operates the largest internet censorship regime in the world, blocking access to thousands of websites including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Internet controls also mean news and commentary critical of the ruling Communist party and information about events like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre are almost impossible to find within China.But millions of Chinese citizens circumvent China?s censorship system, known as the Great Firewall, by using a VPN, allowing unfettered access to any website. The latest directive comes as China prepares for a twice a decade political meeting in Beijing in late 2017, with various factions within the government jockeying for dominance in any potential shuffle of top officials. It also comes on the heels of a 14-month ?cleanup? of internet services announced in January, part of president Xi Jinping?s push for so-called ?internet sovereignty?. ?This is a significantly escalated form of internet control and shows there is unprecedented urgency and desperation at the top of the government,? said Xiao Qiang, a professor focusing on censorship in China at the University of California, Berkeley. ?This is clearly about the highest levels of political struggle and the different factions using the internet as their battlefield.?If Xi?s opponents cannot release information inside China because of the censorship apparatus, they do it outside China and then the information filters back.?Xiao pointed to recent cracks in the Great Firewall, including allegations of corruption levelled by a Chinese businessman in New York that have managed to circulate widely within China. The claims, many unverified, have been seen as damaging to the head of the country?s corruption watchdog and one of Xi?s closest allies. In the coming months Xiao predicted the authorities would step up their internet crackdown: ?There have always been controls, but this will be another level?.The ban on VPNs could also harm academics, software developers and foreign businesses. For years Chinese researchers have complained they lack adequate access to overseas journals and methods to communicate with universities around the world, while developers rely on code hosted on websites based outside China. Foreign businesses in China often use VPNs to secure their company data or communicate with company headquarters. It is not clear whether the ban will affect corporate VPNs.?This is ridiculous. If they?re as interested in security and stability as they say they are, then they should leave VPNs accessible,? Kaiser Kuo, former head of international communications at Chinese tech giant Baidu, posted online. ?The number of people using them in China is really small, but really vocal ? and I don?t think they?ll just take this lying down. Will reflect very badly on the party. Dark days ahead.?Earlier this month a popular Chinese VPN was forced to shut down after ?receiving a notice from regulatory departments?.China has instituted bans on VPNs and other methods to bypass censorship in the past, especially during high-level government meetings in Beijing. But it remains to be seen whether the latest directive will become permanent.

The clearance was given on a review of the traffic regulation plan and provision for the RRTS alignment.

This is because the volume of traffic has remained the same despite the road being denotified as a highway,? he said.The proposed flyover, spanning 538 metres, is pegged at Rs50 crore and its design was changed from combined six-lane to three-lane (each side) split-type one. The middle portion between the two lanes will be used for the RRTS, which will come up on an elevated section, like the metro train system.The authority had proposed the flyover to decongest the city roads as a heavy volume of traffic is witnessed at the intersection.?The design for the flyover has been approved by the RRTS agency.

The clarification from the government came as several businesses were left with huge unsold inventories before the GST kicked in from July 1. The unsold items had an MRP which included all taxes of pre-GST era but with the implementation of new regime, some of the final retail prices have undergone changes because of increase or decrease in tax incidences. The old maximum retail price (MRP) will have to be necessarily displayed on the unsold inventories and the new rates can be reflected by way of pastable stickers alongside, Consumer Affairs Secretary Avinash Srivastava told reporters here. On items where the price has to be increased for unsold stocks, the manufacturer or packer or importer will have to give at least two advertisements in two or more newspapers informing people about the change. However, after September 30, the printed MRP on pre- packaged commodity will have to necessary include the GST rate and no add-on stickers would be allowed. \"The central government hereby, permits the manufacturer or packer or importer of pre-packaged commodities to declare the changed retail sale price (MRP) for three months from July 1-September 30. Declaration of the changed MRP shall be made by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing,\" a government notification said.

That he did so while nursing a damaged steering wheel made it all the more of an achievement but also put the Scuderia on the spot.His team-mate Kimi Raikkonen was quicker on track but they chose not to order Vettel to allow him to pass. That the German is their only title contender could not have been clearer.In their wake Hamilton was on a charge and in turn faster than his team?mate Valtteri Bottas. With passing at the Hungaroring all but impossible this year, he asked Mercedes to tell Bottas to let him through to chase down the leading Ferraris, agreeing that he would give the place back should he fail to overtake them. Bottas let him through and, unable to pass Raikkonen and seven seconds up the road from his team-mate, Hamilton duly gave back the place on the final lap. Raikkonen held second, with Bottas in third and Hamilton fourth.The British driver now trails Vettel by 14 points in the world championship and ceding the place cost him three. With the title fight likely to go to the wire it might yet prove to have been the sportsmanlike gesture that could deny him a fourth drivers? title this year.?I want to win the championship the right way,? he said. ?I don?t know whether that will come back to bite me on the backside or not but I said at the beginning of the year, I want to win it the right way. I do think today was the right way to do things.?Ferrari have a long history of imposing team orders and designating a No1 driver but the Mercedes executive director, Toto Wolff, agreed with Hamilton and drew a stark comparison with how his team and the Scuderia went racing.?We have seen the backlash from decisions that were ruthless and cold blooded and the effect that it had on the brand,? he said. ?You could say: ?Screw it, it still won them the championship, who cares? They are in the history books.? But I do not think that is the right spin and if the purpose of us being here is to do the right things and win in the right way ? sometimes doing it the right way and standing by your values is tough and it was today, believe me.?Giving the place back was no easy feat. Bottas was only just in front of the Red Bull of Max Verstappen and there was a real danger the manoeuvre could have cost Hamilton two places. The team had debated whether it should be done but were clear Hamilton was not instructed to do so and that he was merely sticking to his word.?It was very sportsmanlike behaviour,? said Wolff, who also acknowledged that it could cost Hamilton the title. ?These values won us six championships and it will make us win more championships in years to come. It cost us three points and could cost us the championship and we are perfectly conscious of that. But in terms of how the drivers and this team operates, we stick to what we say and if the consequences are as much as losing the championship, then we will take it.?There was little doubt that Vettel deserved the 25 points, both he and Raikkonen having a pace advantage in the early stage over Mercedes. But he revealed he was wrestling with his damaged car from the off. ?I felt there was something not right on the grid and for the formation lap the steering wheel was not straight,? he said.?Then it got worse and towards the end of the stint it was more difficult. We spoke on the radio about it and I was told to avoid the kerbs but on this track you use them on every corner, so you lose speed. It was good that it is tricky to overtake here. It felt like a very long race.?Ferrari have not won the constructors? championship since 2008 and have not taken the drivers? title since Raikkonen claimed it in 2007. Their step forward to go head-to head with Mercedes this season gives them a real opportunity to end the drought.Raikkonen might have been passed by Hamilton, which would have cost them constructor points, but they opted to gamble on the British driver being unable to do so. It paid off and they can consider their strategy a success but it indicated that they were willing to risk the team championship in favour of backing Vettel for the title.Maurizio Arrivabene, Ferrari?s team principal, praised Raikkonen for being a ?true team player? and Sergio Marchionne, the Ferrari chief executive, admitted the result had come as a relief. ?It was a much?needed win,? he said. ?The great thing is we earned it, this was a tough, tough race and we almost lost it and we got it back.?Vettel holds the lead going into the summer break and he has earned it but Hamilton can also rest easy knowing that he held an honourable line in Hungary. ?The team were in a difficult position but I think today really shows, hopefully, that I am a man of my word,? he said.', ' The police on Wednesday arrested two bikers, who were performing ?Dhoom-style? stunts at Mumbai?s Marine Drive ?to impress girls?.The two arrested accused ?

She said that primary intention was to contain black money, remove counterfeit currency and to terminate lifeline of terror groups.Addressing the press after the resolution, Sitharaman tried to defend the frequent changes of rules during the 50 days demonetisation exercise. She said that it is a sensitive government and that is why ministers responded on a daily basis on what it was doing to assuage the difficulties bore by the common man.MAJORITY BACKING THE DECISION Hitting out at opposition parties, party spokesperson GVL Narsimhan, sharing the dias with the ministersaid, \"Opposition parties which have run a false campaign have realized that public stands with the govt.

The incident was reported from west Delhi?s Tilak Nagar on Sunday.The man, police said, had been assaulting the girls for the past one year. The father of the girls passed away two years ago and their mother, who has cancer, is bedridden.According to the police, he allegedly raped his 17-year-old sister in April last year and molested his 13-year-old sister around the same time. He allegedly sexually abused them whenever he got a chance.?The mother had no idea about her son sexually abusing her daughters. She had given the 22-year-old the responsibility to take care of the two girls,? a police officer said.When questioned, the mother told police that the girls would often refuse to go to the school or tuition with their brother but they never shared any details with her.DCP West, Vijay Kumar, confirmed the incident. ?We have registered a case of rape against the youth and have arrested him. He is being questioned. The investigation in the case is on,? he said.The matter came to fore after the 13-year-old shared her ordeal with her friend, whose father works with an NGO. The friend?s father then approached the police and lodged a formal complaint. In her complaint, the 13-year-old said that the brother terrorized her and her sister. She alleged that he would always look for an opportunity to touch them inappropriately, sometimes outside the house and mostly late at night when everyone was asleep. He allegedly even threatened to throw them out of the house if they dared to complain.?Luckily, the girl shared the episode with her friend who convinced her to narrate it to her father assuring that he would help. The girl said that she did not know who to approach as the 22-year-old claimed to be the owner of the house and she thought that if she complained to her mother, she would not believe her. Based on the complaint, a case was registered and the girls have been rescued. They will now record their statements before the magistrate under 164 CrPc,? an investigator said.', 'The Maldivian opposition said that the military locked down parliament on Monday on the orders of the country?s president in a bid to prevent lawmakers from taking part in a vote to impeach the parliamentary speaker.The main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party said that on the orders of President Yameen Abdul Gayoom, the gates of the parliament were padlocked by members of the armed forces on Monday morning and lawmakers ?were forcibly prevented from entering the parliamentary compound.?In a statement, the opposition party called Yameen?s action ?desperate, illegal and unconstitutional.?There was no immediate comment from the government. The government spokesmen could not be reached by telephone.A no-confidence motion against Speaker Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed was scheduled to be taken up on Monday. The opposition says the motion has gained the support of 45 lawmakers in the 85-member house. However, an uncertainty arose when the election commission announced last week that the four members who supported the motion had lost their seats because they left the ruling party.The motion was considered a severe blow to Yameen, whose control over parliament was threatened by a new understanding between the Maldives? former strongman and its first democratically elected president, Mohamed Nasheed. The Maldivian Democratic Party routed Yameen?s party in local council elections earlier this year.A similar opposition bid to oust the speaker was thwarted in March when the government defeated it by 48 votes, with none opposing. At the time, opposition lawmakers were either evicted or walked out from a vote on ousting the speaker following a dispute over problems with the electronic voting system.The coalition?s plan to wrest the parliamentary majority was aimed at reforming the judiciary, elections commission and other bodies perceived as being partial toward Yameen.In March, Nasheed and former strongman Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and two other parties signed an agreement to form an opposition alliance.Maumoon runs a rival faction within the Progressive Party of Maldives, which is led by the current president, his half-brother.Nasheed was jailed in 2015 for 13 years for ordering the arrest of a senior judge when he was president in 2012.However, he traveled to Britain last year on medical leave and received asylum there. Three other leading politicians have also been jailed after trials criticized internationally for a lack of due process. Yameen is accused of rolling back many of the democratic gains since the Maldives became a multiparty democracy in 2008.', \"As part of a series of meetings between the Prime Minister and BJP MPs from various states, Narendra Modi today meet Members of Parliament (MPs) from Delhi, Bihar, Punjab, Haryana, Assam and Himachal Pradesh.

Telling the Prime Minister that open arms of friendship are the very hallmarks of being a Kansan, the Governor said Srinu embodied the essence of what it means to be a Kansan. \"His friends describe him as charming, caring and loving.

Moon?s conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, had refused to engage in substantive dialogue with Pyongyang unless the isolated regime made a tangible commitment to denuclearisation.The Red Cross said it hoped for a positive response from its counterpart in the North; mooted family reunions in early October would be the first in two years.Millions of families were separated by the conflict that sealed the division of the peninsula. Many died without getting a chance to see or hear from their families on the other side of the heavily-fortified border, across which all civilian communication is banned. Only about 60,000 members of divided families are still left in the South. ?North Korea should respond to our sincere proposals if it really seeks peace on the Korean Peninsula,? said Cho Myoung-gyon, Seoul?s unification minister in charge of North Korea affairs.Cho stressed that Seoul ?would not seek collapse of the North or unification through absorbing the North? and urged Pyongyang to restore inter-Korea communication channels, including a shuttered military hotline. Moon, who took power in May, has advocated dialogue with the nuclear-armed North as a means of bringing it to the negotiating table and vowed to play a more active role in global efforts to tame the South?s unpredictable neighbour.But Pyongyang has staged a series of missile launches in violation of UN resolutions, most recently on 4 July when it test-fired its first ICBM, a move which triggered global alarm and a push by the US president, Donald Trump, to impose harsher UN sanctions on the country.Washington has also called on China, the North?s sole ally, to put more pressure on Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear ambitions, which have advanced rapidly under the North?s leader, Kim Jong-un. ?We make the proposal for a meeting ? aimed at stopping all hostile activities that escalate military tension along the land border,? the defence ministry said in a statement.[NEW]The European Union offered European support for South Korean efforts to negotiate with North Korea, but said it was also considering tougher sanctions on Pyongyang following its first intercontinental ballistic missile test.In a statement Monday, the EU?s executive arm condemned the test earlier this month as a ?serious threat to international peace and security? and urged an end to such actions.The latest missile test ? which Kim described as a ?gift? to the Americans ? was seen as a milestone in Pyongyang?s quest to build a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that can hit the US mainland.The proposed meetings, if realised, would be a ?rare opportunity to ease tension that has built up for 10 years?, said Cheong Seong-chang, analyst at the Sejong Institute, a thinktank.?It would at least help let off some steam out of the current crisis, although the North would still maintain that it would not give up its weapons programmes,? he said. The agenda for the meeting could include moves to suspend propaganda campaigns operated on both sides of the border for years, Cheong added. The South?s military has deployed dozens of giant loudspeakers along the tense border to blare out a mix of world news, K-pop songs and other propaganda targeting young North Korean soldiers. It has also occasionally launched giant balloons containing anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border despite warnings of military retaliation by the North.The North has responded with its own propaganda broadcasts and sent anti-Seoul leaflets via giant balloons across the border.

Sir John Thursby Community College in Burnley, Lancashire, reacted to concerns that some hijabs were being worn incorrectly by introducing a uniform version. However, the move has come under fire from some Muslim parents and pupils, who feel the uniform hijabs are uncomfortable and not modest enough. They have launched an online petition, signed by 150 people, protesting against the lack of consultation over the new uniformed hijab. \"Unfortunately, there was very little consultation by parents or the girls attending the school. Consequently, a scarf designed by the school has been created. It is very tight and in some cases too short as some of the girls have long hair and so it defeats the object to wear it,\" the petition reads. It also questions the \"real agenda\" behind the move and if it is to \"put girls off\" wearing a headscarf. Headmaster David Burton has written to parents to defend the policy and dismiss suggestions that the school is against headscarves as untrue. \"We are sorry that there have been suggestions that the school is against headscarves. This is not true. We respect fully the wishes of girls to wear a headscarf and we always have done,\" he said.

After the sudden break-up with Lalu Prasad\\'s RJD over corruption allegations last week, Nitish aligned again with the BJP and formed a coalition government on July 27.

A team of scientists from Stanford University have been surprised to discover an abundance of marine life apparently thriving in the crater of Bikini Atoll, which was declared a nuclear wasteland after the bombings, with its 167 inhabitants relocated to other islands.Steve Palumbi, a professor in marine sciences at the university, said the effects of radiation poisoning on ocean life have never been studied in-depth, and his team?s initial research suggests it is ?remarkably resilient?. Animals studied by scientists in and around the Chernobyl blast showed deformities and mutations, but the Stanford teams initial research suggest the marine life in Bikini may have fared significantly better. Palumbi?s team discovered a diverse eco-system of animal life in and around the bomb crater, including coral as big as ?cars?, hundreds of schools of fish including tuna, sharks and snapper, and coconut crabs devouring radioactive coconuts on the shore. Palumbi said to the naked eye the crabs, fish and coral of Bikini Atoll look perfectly normal and healthy, and some of the coral has been around for decades ? with evidence it may have begun growing as soon as 10 years after the last bombs were dropped.?The lagoon is full of schools of fish all swirling around the living coral. In a strange way they are protected by the history of this place, the fish populations are better than in some other places because they have been left alone, the sharks are more abundant and the coral are big. It is a remarkable environment, quite odd.? Palumbi?s team concentrated their research efforts on the coral and coconut crabs ? which are the size of hub caps ? because they have long-life spans, allowing the scientists to delve into what effect the radiation exposure has had on the animals DNA after building up in their systems for many years. Because fish have relatively short life-spans it is possible the worst-affected fish died off many decades ago, said Palumbi, and the fish living in Bikini Atoll today are only subject to low-levels of radiation exposure as they frequently swim in and out of the atoll. ?This is the most destructive thing we have ever done to the ocean, dropping 23 atomic bombs on it, yet the ocean is really striving to come back to life,? said Palumbi. ?The fact there is life there and the life there is trying to come back from the most violent thing we?ve ever done to it is pretty hopeful.?Even though plant, animal and ocean life is showing strong signs of recovery, humans are still unable to live and work on the atoll, besides a few caretakers who bring food and water supplies with them, and keep up the islands facilities. A United Nations report in 2012 said the effects of radiation were long-lasting. Special rapporteur Calin Georgescu, in a report to the UN human rights council, said ?near-irreversible environmental contamination? had led to the loss of livelihoods and many people continued to experience ?indefinite displacement?.The water cannot be drunk because of continued contamination, the seafood cannot be eaten, and plants cannot be farmed because of contaminated soil. More than half of the 167 original inhabitants of Bikini Atoll have now died, and many went to their graves still longing to return to their homeland. According to a paper by Timothy J. Jorgensen, associate professor of radiation medicine at Georgetown University, former residents of Bikini Atoll started showing cancers related to radiation exposure in the 1960s. Those down-wind of the explosions had burns and depressed blood counts. Those on islands further afield showed elevated risk for cancers, particularly thyroid cancers and leukaemia, and have been involved in a protracted compensation claim with the United States for decades. ?What happened to the Marshall Islanders next is a sad story of their constant relocation from island to island, trying to avoid the radioactivity that lingered for decades,? writes Jorgensen. ?Over the years following the testing, the Marshall Islanders living on the fallout-contaminated islands ended up breathing, absorbing, drinking and eating considerable amounts of radioactivity.?', 'Allahabad, Aug 01 (PTI) The Allahabad High Court today said it would hear afresh the appeals filed by Rajesh and Nupur Talwar challenging their conviction in the murder of their daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj, seven months after reserving its judgement in the matter.

It then takes us to a fictitious village in Delhi-Haryana border area, Mubipura, where people are gearing up for a wedding. Suddenly, cops reach the place looking for men to be sterilized. When the men try to hide, the cops hunt them down and drag them even as a 70-year-old and a 13-year-old male ask policemen to consider the futility of including them in the government-ordered drive. Indu Sarkar soon moves to the central character, Indu (Kriti) - an orphan who wants to become a poet but is told she must only dream to become a good wife and make a family. Following the advice, she marries Navin Sarkar (Tota Roy Chowdhury) who dreams of money, power and fame, while Indu?s dream is only to be a good wife. For almost half of the fiIm, Indu Sarkar remains the story of a docile, humble and meek orphan who surrenders to every whims and fancies of her husband even as she fights her own stammering and a lack of confidence.How this rather ?homely? woman stumbles upon victims of a police raid in a slum, decides to fight for them and eventually becomes one of the most powerful voices of dissent during the Emergency, form the rest of the narrative.Neil Nitin Mukesh in a still from the film.While the film was publicised as a film ?on Emergency?, it actually oscillates between a political drama and a typical Bollywood film about a couple. Unfortunately, the transition between the two narratives is neither smooth nor convincing.One of the saddest moments in the movie comes when Indu, after she has left her husband?s house for the sake of a couple of lost orphan kids, decides to sign the divorce papers Navin sends. When asked why she agreed for the divorce, she says, ?Saath reh kar acchi biwi nahi ban payi, ho sakta hai alag ho kar sukh de paun. (I could not be a good wife, maybe I can give him some comfort by staying away).? As if, all the protest and fight for freedom from a dictatorial government was nothing but a tool to pacify the husband.The background score of Indu Sarkar is too loud and misplaced. At times when a rather emotional moment is approaching, what you hear is the loud melodramatic sound usually used in Bollywood suspense dramas. Anupam Kher in a in a still from the film.Despite having gathered a group of critically appreciated actors, Madhur Bhandarkar fails to make the best use of them. Neil Nitin Mukesh is one of the most wasted talents in the movie. He has given some of his best performances as a mean, high-on-power person but his act as ?chief? in Indu Sarkar appears too superficial. Anupam Kher and Kriti Kulhari take the lead in acting department and stay true to their characters for most of the part. The supporting casts including Sheeba Chaddha, Ankur Vikal and Zakir Hussain, among others appear genuine in their roles.Neil Nitin Mukesh in a still from the film.However, the over-dramatic tone of the film kills their performances and leaves us with dialogues like ?Ek goli ne mere jawan, 6 foot ke bete ko 6 inch ki tasveer bana diya.?Trying to find logic in Indu Sarkar often becomes a task. For example, why does Indu keep roaming around in a rickshaw/auto in the Turkman Gate area every time she needs to witness an eye-opener about the Emergency when she is otherwise driven around in her husband?s car? Or, for that matter, why do the protesters (led by Anupam Kher as ?Nanaji?) keep naming each other when they meet inside a cinema hall to avoid getting caught by the cops? Isn?t the entire purpose of disguise defeated if they use the real names? What is the reason, do you ask? Well, Bollywood is the only word that comes to our mind.Kriti Kulhari in a still from the film.For those interested in the politics of films, there are two ways to look at Madhur Bhandarkar?s Indu Sarkar.One is to look it as a propaganda film against the Congress party, aims at showcasing the atrocities inflicted upon various communities during the Emergency. There is a subtle, yet, extremely clear attempt to highlight Muslims forming a major portion of the victims. We have Neil Nitin Mukesh channelling Sanjay Gandhi as the prime minister?s son who is only referred to as the ?chief? while the PM is referred to as ?mummyji?. The unofficial ban on Kishore Kumar from radio and television after he refused to sing for Sanjay Gandhi also gets a mention in the film. On the other hand, you can see Indu Sarkar as a double-edged sword. While it depicts the Emergency and the Gandhi family as the perpetrators of cruelty and injustice inflicted upon the masses, the film actually shows the misuse of power. If Madhur Bhandarkar wanted to patronise the ruling party, the irony of his own film is lost on him. The irony of Indu Sarkar is that it is so indulgent in highlighting the importance of free speech and democracy that you could change a few names, few other situations and it could well have been a film about the crisis India is facing today: People with allegiances to the ruling party exploiting the masses and even politicians at their own will.So, in the sheer hope that Madhur actually aimed for the latter political purpose, two stars for Indu Sarkar.Follow @htshowbiz for more', 'The India Today-Axis survey ahead of the crucial Assembly elections in five states predicts a hung Assembly in Uttar Pradesh and a major boost to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab.While the Congress is likely to snatch Punjab from the Akali-Dal-BJP combine, the BJP is likely to trump the Congress to power in Uttarakhand and retain Goa.', 'Google has started rolling out the Android Nougat 7.1.2 update to all Pixel and Pixel XL users across the globe.

The city-headquartered lender, which had made a name for itself by consistently delivering 30 per cent profit growth for more than 32 quarters without a break till about two years ago, and then slipped to the 20 per cent levels with sluggish economic growth, saw its margins narrowing by 10 bps to 4.10 per cent during the third quarter ended December 31. The Aditya Puri-headed bank also saw redemptions of USD 3 billion worth of NRI deposits raised under a special window opened by the RBI in 2013 which led to a USD 2-billion reduction in the foreign currency loan book. HDFC Bank had raised the largest amount through this window. The lender saw a 37 per cent surge in the current and saving account balances which helped the share of the low-cost deposits ratio to 45 per cent after the November 8 demonetisation. It can be noted banks were not able to benefit from the surge fully because of 100 per cent CRR on new deposits till December 8. Deputy Managing Director Paresh Sukthankar acknowledged this is the slowest profit growth ever for over two decade-old bank but defended it, saying this is because of the external environment, and declined to give any guidance on how it sees the next few quarters. He, however, said the private lender will continue to outgrow the system, and gave out data on both deposits and advances growth where it has achieved this. He said the bank lost out on \"fairly meaningful\" quantum of fees from point of sale terminals and ATM usage during the demonetisation exercise (Nov 9-Dec 30), but said this is for the benefit of larger good in the long-term. Sukthankar made a plea for a \"balance\" to be achieved on the merchant discount rates so that those investing in the infrastructure also benefit. But the market lapped the bank counter as they believe the lender did well in a challenging time.

Most automobile companies except Bajaj opposed the plea.The objective behind a cleaner fuel technology would not be achieved if older vehicles continue to flood the market, said Epca, a Supreme-court appointed autonomous body that advises government on ecological issues.The court also rejected the Centre?s argument that the BS-IV rollout only banned manufacturing and not the sale of the BS-III vehicles.Setback to car companies.

While BS-III vehicles emit 2.30gm of carbon monoxide per kg of fuel, the emission drops to 1gm per kg in BS-IV vehicles.Transition to BS-IV could lead to a substantial drop in particulate matter emissions. For instance, new trucks could see an 80% drop in emissions and cars by 50%, Epca told the court.Similarly, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions ? a big concern for two-wheelers ? could drop between 41 and 80%, depending on the engine size, it said. The norms have to be followed by auto makers as well as fuel companies. The solicitor general told the court that BS-IV fuel would be available across India from April 1.Industry would abide by the order, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) president Vinod K Dasari said. The industry had been ready with BS-IV manufacturing since 2010 but the sale of these vehicles was not possible nationwide due to lack of BS-IV fuel, Dasari said. India has set a deadline of 2020 to switch to BS-VI norms, giving a miss to stage V.

The remarkably well preserved eggs give an insight into the \"mother croc\" that laid them, researchers said. They are similar to the eggs of modern crocodiles, suggesting crocodile eggs have changed little in shape in the last 150 million years. Palaeontologists say the prehistoric crocodile ancestor would have spanned two metres, based on the size of the larger eggs. \"The fact that they are from the Late Jurassic makes these eggs the oldest crocodilian eggs known so far,\" said Joao Russo of Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal. \"This new discovery from Portugal extends the knowledge of this type of egg by approximately 40 million years,\" said Russo.

The remarks of Natarajan are significant because he is said to wield considerable influence in the AIADMK, particularly after the demise of J Jayalalithaa, and his allegation against the BJP comes against the souring relations between the two parties. Later when asked by reporters about the attempts to divide the party and dismiss the government, Natarajan said definitely attempts were on at the behest of S Gurumurthy, the RSS ideologue. Significantly, Gurumurthy, who has taken over as Editor of Thuglaq magazine after the demise of founder-editor Cho S Ramaswamy, had made veiled remarks at the annual readers interaction on Saturday in Chennai that while one party was already under the control of a family (apparent reference to DMK), another party was going into the control of a family (AIADMK). Natarajan dared Gurumurthy to come out \"in the open\" and oppose them and \"not hide behind\". He also questioned the security being given to Gurumurthy who held no position in the government. He said while they support Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there were others who were creating problem for the AIADMK. Natarajan said when powerful forces were acting against Jayalalithaa after MGRs death, it was he and his family who had protected her like a shield. \"There were just four or five of us who protected her...for 36 years since then, my wife Sasikala was bearing her on her shoulders,\" Natarajan said delving on the hard sacrifices that he and his family had made to protect Jayalalithaa and thereby preserve the AIADMK from the designs of the rival DMK. He said unnecessary controversies and questions were being raised over Jayalalithaas treatment in the hospital. Her entire treatment has been recorded. She was with a clear mind while in the hospital, he claimed.

This will be a soft launch of sorts in August, after which we can proceed towards making CP a no-vehicle zone in phases based on the response,? the official told HT.?We will study traffic flow, parking issues and experiences of pedestrians and shop owners,? he said, adding that based on the feedback, they will decide whether to make the arrangement permanent.The three-month trial for a car-free Connaught Place, which the NDMC had planned in February, was put off after opposition from traders at the popular shopping hub.Traders have threatened to protest again, saying Saturdays, Sundays, and even Mondays were peak days of business for them.?We are absolutely against it. It is not practical at all to not allow vehicles inside Connaught Place. And this soft launch is the perfect way to kill business. ?Saturday and Sunday and even Monday are the peak days for us. We will go all out to stop it. We can?t allow them to kill our livelihoods,? New Delhi Traders? Association (NDTA) president Atul Bhargav said.Traffic at Connaught Place is a nightmare on most days. The situation worsens on weekends and public holidays.The car-free plan, given a go-ahead by the Union urban development ministry after extensive talks with NDMC and traffic police in early January, aims to decongest the heritage shopping arcade which gets around 5 lakh visitors a day. Nearly 2,000 parking spaces ? 1,500 in inner circle and 400-500 in middle circle ? are to be removed.Authorities had proposed two ways to implement the project. In the first, cars will be allowed to enter from Janpath, people will alight at Palika Bazar or Palika Parking and exit through Baba Kharak Singh Marg. The second plan had proposed that cars will be allowed in the middle circle but only to drop visitors and shoppers, making it a no-parking zone.Officials say free ?park and ride? services from major parking areas at Shivaji Stadium, Baba Kharak Singh Marg and Palika parking will be made available. The council has plans to make battery-operated vehicles and cycles-for-hire available to get to and come back from Connaught Place.Pedestrian-only zones are popular abroad.

', '(Eds: Updating with additional inputs) From Aditi Khanna London, May 13 (PTI) An Indian-origin doctor based in London had warned against the cyber-hack of the UKs state-run National Health Service just days before it crippled the countrys network. Krishna Chinthapalli, a neurology registrar atÂ\\xa0the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, had said an increasing number of hospitals could be shut down by ransomeware attacks inÂ\\xa0an article on the vulnerability of the NHS network in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday, two days before the major cyber hack of the National Health Service (NHS) system on Friday. He had highlighted an incident at Papworth Hospital near Cambridge where a nurse clicked on a malicious link and malware infected her computer and started to encrypt sensitive files. \"Fortunately, the hospitals daily data backup had just been completed. The IT director admitted that they were very lucky, saying, Timing absolutely was everything for us,\" Chinthapalli wrote. \"We should be prepared: more hospitals will almost certainly be shut down by ransomware this year,\" he wrote. The revelation came as UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed today that as many as 48 NHS trusts had been affected by theÂ\\xa0large-scale cyber-hack by an international criminal gang wreaked havoc around the country. After chairing an emergency meeting of the COBRA committee, Rudd said that all but 6 trusts were now back to normal. Confirming that 97 per cent of hospitals were \"back to normal\", she said,Â\\xa0\"This is a virus that attacked Windows platforms. The fact is the NHS has fallen victim to this.\" The Opposition Liberal Democrat and Labour parties have both demanded an inquiry into the cyber-attack. Patients of the state-funded country-wide service are still facing days of chaos as appointments and surgeries were cancelled after NHS organisations from London to Scotland were hit in the \"ransomware\" attack yesterday. NHS Digital said the impact of the cyberattack could continue. \"The situation is changing and impacting organisations in a range of different ways,\" a spokesperson said. Ciaran Martin, who leads the UKs National Cyber Security Centre, said his team was doing everything in their power to get \"vital services\" back up and running. \"We are very aware that attacks on critical services such as the NHS have a massive impact on individuals and their families, and we are doing everything in our power to help them restore these vital services,\" he said. \"Its important to understand that cyber attacks can be different from other forms of crime in that their sometimes highly technical and anonymous nature means it can take some time to understand how it worked, who was behind it and what the impact is,\" he told the BBC. Critically ill patients are being diverted to unaffected hospitals as computer systems failed in A&E units and doctors were locked out of test results, X-rays and patient records. NHS England said patients needing emergency treatment should go to Accidents & Emergency (A&E) or access emergency services as they normally would. However, there have been some reports of ambulances being diverted from affected hospitals and individual NHS trusts have asked registered patients not to attend unless it is urgent. Londons Barts Health NHS Trust, the largest trust in the UK, cancelled all outpatient appointments at its five hospitals today. The NHS has not been affected in Wales and Northern Ireland. The assault is part of an attack that has affected organisations in more than 70 countries, including the United States, China, Russia and Spain, disrupting power and telephone companies. Gangs are thought to have used tools stolen from US spies and dumped online by hackers linked to Russia. \"This is not targeted at the NHS, its an international attack and a number of countries and organisations have been affected,\" British Prime Minister Theresa May said. \"The National Cyber Security Centre is working closely with NHS Digital to ensure they support the organisations concerned and that they protect patient safety. We are not aware of any evidence that patient data has been compromised,\" she said. The attack came after warnings of NHS vulnerability, with cybersecurity allegedly neglected despite a series of attempted hacks. Ransomware programmes, which are sent by email and spread swiftly, can be bought on the dark web with sellers negotiating a percentage of the takings. \"We will be advising NHS trusts to modernise their platforms,\" UK home secretary Amber Rudd said. The malware used in the NHS attack is called WannaCry and attacks Windows operating systems. It encrypts files on a users computer, blocking them from view, before demanding money, via an on-screen message, to access them again. The demand is for a payment of 300 dollars in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock the files.

', 'It was designed as an impregnable deep-freeze to protect the world?s most precious seeds from any global disaster and ensure humanity?s food supply forever. But the Global Seed Vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel.The vault is on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. When it was opened in 2008, the deep permafrost through which the vault was sunk was expected to provide ?failsafe? protection against ?the challenge of natural or man-made disasters?.But soaring temperatures in the Arctic at the end of the world?s hottest ever recorded year led to melting and heavy rain, when light snow should have been falling. ?It was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there and that it would experience extreme weather like that,? said Hege Njaa Aschim, from the Norwegian government, which owns the vault.?A lot of water went into the start of the tunnel and then it froze to ice, so it was like a glacier when you went in,? she told the Guardian. Fortunately, the meltwater did not reach the vault itself, the ice has been hacked out, and the precious seeds remain safe for now at the required storage temperature of -18C.But the breach has questioned the ability of the vault to survive as a lifeline for humanity if catastrophe strikes. ?It was supposed to [operate] without the help of humans, but now we are watching the seed vault 24 hours a day,? Aschim said. ?We must see what we can do to minimise all the risks and make sure the seed bank can take care of itself.?The vault?s managers are now waiting to see if the extreme heat of this winter was a one-off or will be repeated or even exceeded as climate change heats the planet. The end of 2016 saw average temperatures over 7C above normal on Spitsbergen, pushing the permafrost above melting point.?The question is whether this is just happening now, or will it escalate?? said Aschim. The Svalbard archipelago, of which Spitsbergen is part, has warmed rapidly in recent decades, according to Ketil Isaksen, from Norway?s Meteorological Institute. ?The Arctic and especially Svalbard warms up faster than the rest of the world. The climate is changing dramatically and we are all amazed at how quickly it is going,? Isaksen told the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet.The vault managers are now taking precautions, including major work to waterproof the 100m-long tunnel into the mountain and digging trenches into the mountainside to channel meltwater and rain away. They have also removed electrical equipment from the tunnel that produced some heat and installed pumps in the vault itself in case of a future flood.Aschim said there was no option but to find solutions to ensure the enduring safety of the vault: ?We have to find solutions. It is a big responsibility and we take it very seriously. We are doing this for the world.??This is supposed to last for eternity,? said Ã\\x85smund Asdal at the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre, which operates the seed vault.', 'After morale-breaking drubbing in Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, the question of who controls the Samajwadi Party might have become irrelevant for some time, but the bitterness between party founder father Mulayam Singh and SP president Akhilesh Yadav continues.Lok Sabha MP Mulayam Singh Yadav slammed Akhilesh Yadav for his revolt against the then party leadership and family ahead of Uttar Pradesh election.Mulayam Singh Yadav said, \"One who betrayed his father, can\\'t be a friend of others.

When a person has a medical emergency behind the wheel, fellow passengers and motorists also face risk of death or serious injury. \"A large number of traffic incidents are caused by medical conditions while driving, specifically cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infraction and myocardial ischemia,\" said Kayvan Najarian, from University of Michigan in the US. \"The medical event interferes with the drivers ability to safely drive and operate the car, causing the accident,\" said Najarian. Researchers, in collaboration with Japanese automotive manufacturer Toyota, wanted to move towards technology that can monitor and analyse the physiology of the person driving and predict if they are going to have adverse cardiac events. \"We identified the challenges, potential solutions, hardware options and algorithmic approaches that could be potentially used,\" Najarian said. \"We concluded that cardiac events were conditions that are more feasible to detect with technology in the vehicle,\" he added. Researchers are creating a system that could be placed in the vehicle to monitor and predict an adverse cardiac event. \"We would like to test hardware we had previously identified, and improve and validate our algorithmic solutions to see what it will take to generate a system that could look at the physiology of a person, provided by high-density electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, as well as other medical measurements,\" Najarian said. Their goal is to come up with a system that would predict the occurrence of adverse cardiac events in real time. Researchers are using machine-learning models to analyse the data collected from in-hospital and in-vehicle subjects. The research team will then test the system on real-time prediction of cardiac events. \"There are actually quite a few obstacles that were identified,\" Najarian said. \"You cant have clinical-grade monitoring devices in the vehicle. You need to use a high-quality monitoring device in the vehicle that, despite all the in-vehicle noise, could reliably register the drivers ECG without being large and obtrusive,\" he added. The research team will begin gathering the physiological data from the driver using heart monitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Such monitors are patches placed on the drivers chest that analyse physiological data in real time.

Bollywood actors Shah Rukh Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who endorsed its portal Addsbook.com, are also named in the complaint. Promoters of Webwork Trade Links, Anurag Jain and Sandesh Verma, duped people using the two actors as brand ambassadors of his shadow firm addsbook.com, the complaint alleged. According to the complaint, which is now part of the FIR, the company opened a \"shadow company\", Addsbook Marketing Pvt, which was launched on December 10, 2016 with brand ambassadors \"Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Shahrukh Khan\". \"People have invested heavily as they were influenced by both celebrities,\" it alleged. However, the actors are not mentioned as either accused or suspects by the Uttar Pradesh Police, which had probed the matter earlier.

', 'Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman John Urschel has abruptly retired from the NFL after just three seasons, the team announced on Thursday.The 26-year-old from Winnipeg, who is a doctoral candidate in applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was expected to compete for a starting role at center or guard in training camp, which gets under way this week in suburban Baltimore.Urschel?s surprise decision comes two days after the release of a medical study that further underscored the link between the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and participation in football. Researchers at Boston University and the Boston Veterans Affairs health system examined 111 deceased NFL players? brains that were donated to scientific research and found CTE in 110 of them, or 99% of those studied.The Baltimore Sun and ESPN said that Urschel?s decision was linked to the results of the study, citing anonymous sources close to the team.Urschel?s agent, when reached by the Guardian on Thursday, said the player has no statement or comment and will not be doing media at this time.?This morning, John Urschel informed me of his decision to retire from football,? Ravens coach John Harbaugh said in a statement Thursday. ?We respect John and respect his decision. We appreciate his efforts over the past three years and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.?Urschel has been pursuing his doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the offseason with a concentration on spectral graph theory, numerical linear algebra and machine learning. He earned his bachelor?s and master?s in mathematics at Penn State, where he played on the football team and was chosen by the Ravens in the fifth round of the 2014 NFL draft.A January profile of Urschel for HBO?s newsmagazine Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel found the lineman at odds with reconciling his two gifts. He further elaborated on the dilemma in a first-person essay for the Players? Tribune in 2015.?I recognize that this is somewhat irrational, but I am doing it,? Urschel told HBO?s Bernard Goldberg. ?It?s more important to me that I?m able to do the two things I love. I don?t know if people have really done things that I?ve done before. I don?t know if they?ll do it after me. But I enjoy carving out my own path and not listening to what people say I can and I can?t do.?By retiring after three full seasons, Urschel is eligible for an NFL pension.Urschel is not the first player to attribute early retirement to fears over the connection between football and CTE. In March 2015, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland retired after one season, a promising rookie campaign that saw him lead the team in tackles, due to concerns over the long-term effects of head trauma.', 'Customers will not suffer any loss if unauthorised electronic banking transactions are reported within three days and the amount involved will be credited in the accounts concerned within 10-days, the Reserve Bank said on Thursday. In case the third party fraud is reported with a delay of four to seven working days, a customer will face liability of up to Rs 25,000. However, in cases where the loss is due to negligence by the account holder (such as sharing of payment credentials), the customer will bear the entire loss until the unauthorised transaction is reported to the bank. Any loss occurring after reporting of the unauthorised transaction will be borne by the bank, RBI said while issuing revised directions on Customer Protection Limiting Liability of Customers in Unauthorised Electronic Banking Transactions. RBI said the revised directions are being issued amidst recent surge in customer grievances relating to unauthorised transactions resulting in debits to their accounts/cards. REPORT FRAUD WITHIN 7 DAYS OR ELSE...There will be \"zero liability of a customer\" in case of third party breach where the deficiency lies \"neither with the bank nor with the customer but lies elsewhere in the system\". However, the customer will have to notify the bank within three working days of receiving the communication from the bank regarding the unauthorised transaction. A customer\\'s entitlement to zero liability will also arise where the unauthorised transaction occurs due to \"contributory fraud/negligence/deficiency on the part of the bank (irrespective of whether or not the transaction is reported by the customer)\", RBI said. The maximum liability of a customer will be Rs 25,000 in cases where the responsibility for the unauthorised electronic banking transaction lies neither with the bank nor with the customer, but lies elsewhere in the system and when there is a delay of four to seven working days. If the fraud is report after seven days, the customer liability will be determined as per the bank\\'s board approved policy. The maximum liability of a savings bank account customer will be Rs 10,000 in such cases. Referring to reversal timeline for Zero Liability/ Limited Liability of customer, RBI said the bank should credit (shadow reversal) the amount involved in the unauthorised electronic transaction to the customer\\'s account within 10 working days of reporting of the fraud. This has to be done without waiting for settlement of insurance claim, if any, RBI added. RBI further said that banks must ask their customers to mandatorily register for SMS alerts and wherever available register for e-mail alerts, for electronic banking transactions. ', 'Austria?s parliament has passed a law allowing authorities to expropriate the house in which Adolf Hitler was born in 1889.The law, passed on Wednesday night, ends years of dispute between the building?s owner, Gerlinde Pommer, and the authorities in Braunau am Inn. For years, Pommer refused to sell the building or allow it to be renovated.Pommer, who once ran it as a guesthouse and was compensated by the government with a generous level of rent to prevent it from becoming a lure for neo-Nazi tourists, is due to be compensated for the loss of the three-storey house with an undisclosed sum. But quite what the government plans to do with it remains unclear.While their main aim is to prevent the building becoming a shrine for the steady stream of neo-Nazi supporters who still make their way to Braunau, there has been an ongoing discussion over what more positive purpose it might serve. Ideas have ranged from turning it into a labour office or a cultural centre to tearing it down altogether, though detractors say that would amount to an attempt to erase Austria?s Nazi past. Heritage experts are against pulling it down, arguing the house has an important place in Braunau?s architectural history.Marcus Franz, an independent politician, has suggested the Bulgarian wrapping artist Christo should be invited to cover it up as an art installation.Previous uses have included a workshop for people with learning difficulties and a day centre operated by a local charity, which rented the building from Pommer but was forced to give up the lease after she refused to carry out any repairs.Hitler was born on the top floor of the house on 20 April 1889. Close to the border with Germany, Braunau has never been able to shake its association with the Nazi leader. ?It is not so seldom that neo-Nazis stop in front of the house to be photographed making the Hitler greeting,? Harry Buchmayr, a Social Democrat who lives in Braunau, told parliament. Walter Rosenkranz, of the rightwing Freedom party, defended parliament?s decision to buy the building. ?Expropriation is not a nice thing, rather the last resort,? he said. ?But we?ve had five years of negotiations that were carried out in a very considerate way, but which didn?t lead to any result.?', 'New Delhi, Dec 25 (PTI) Regional Transport Offices in the national capital are set to go cashless from January when fees for all services including driving licence, auto permit and fitness certificate can be paid electronically.

That will end our live coverage. To summarize: A Nevada parole board has voted unanimously to allow OJ Simpson to go free as early as October, citing the former NFL star?s compliance with prison rules, his lack of prior convictions, his low risk of committing another crime, his community support and stable post-release plans. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to read Amanda Holpuch?s full report on today?s hearing below.\\n\\n8.19pm BST\\n20:19\\n\\nSimpson?s attorney said he never believed parole was a sure thing: ?It was hard to know the certainty of this,? LaVergne says. ?Mr Simpson is obviously a very polarizing figure. He?s very well loved, but he?s also held into contempt by a lot of people.? \\n\\n8.15pm BST\\n20:15\\n\\nLaVergne now berating a reporter who?s brought up retired correctional officer Jeffrey Felix who worked at Lovelock and talked about Simpson. The attorney says he?s started the process of getting Felix?s pension stipped. Interestingly, when Simpson was sitting in front of a hot mic in the moments before the parole board?s decision was announced, the microphone overheard him saying he might sue Felix.\\n\\n8.11pm BST\\n20:11\\n\\nIt?s official: Inmate No. 1027820 at Lovelock correctional facility will be released in October. Now Simpson?s attorney Malcolm LaVergne is fielding questions from media. LaVergne says Fremong?s testimony in favor of Simpson was very helpful in helping broker Simpson?s release. Right now Fremong is sitting with Simpson and his family inside the facility, he says. ?They?re friends,? LaVergne says. ?This was a big mishap.?\\n\\n7.55pm BST\\n19:55\\n\\nNow the parole board is back in the room, saving OJ from the hot mic (and himself). Tony Corda is speaking. He says Simpson deserved to go to prison for his crime, but he?s complied with the rules of the prison, he?s a low risk to reoffend, he has community support and stable post-release plans. The question is whether he?s served enough time in prison on this case. Corda agrees he has.Jackson and Endel also concur. And finally Bisbee votes to grant parole, completing the unanimous 4-0 decision.BREAKING: O.J. Simpson granted parole when eligible in October https://t.co/nc8Su7r49N?Thank you!?

Now Simpson is smiling and laughing with others in the room on a hot mic (!), talking about the challenges of the teleconference format.\\n\\n7.34pm BST\\n19:34\\n\\nIf there was any surprise to today?s routine hearing, it was Simpson?s semi-confrontational posture to the board, specifically the self-justification of the robbery in his opening remarks. That said, every testimony was in his favor and by all accounts he?s shown himself to be rehabilitated: a model prisoner. Most seem to agree he?s served more than enough time for the crime he?s been incarcerated for. All signs indicate he will be paroled today and released on or around 1 October, but it?s not as if Simpson?s very American tale hasn?t offered up final-reel twists in the past. Stay tuned.\\n\\n7.19pm BST\\n19:19\\n\\nBisbee calls the hearing into recess so the board can move into deliberations, which could take up to a half hour. The four-member panel must be unanimous to make a decision. If they are divided, the other two commissioners are brought in to add their feedback. From there, it?s subject to a simple majority. A 3-3 deadlock will result in another hearing in six months? time.Updated\\nat 7.22pm BST\\n\\n\\n7.16pm BST\\n19:16\\n\\nFromong closes: ?We all make mistakes. OJ made his. He?s been here and from what I?ve heard he?s been a model inmate. He?s been an example to others. During the trial I recommended he serve one to three years. That?s what I recommended to the DA. I?m here to say that I?ve known OJ for a long time. I don?t feel he?s a threat to anyone out there. ?He?s a good man. I know that he does a lot for other people and I feel that nine-and-a-half-to-33 years was way too long. And I feel that it?s time to give him a second chance. It?s time for him to go home to his family, his friends. This is a good man, he made a mistake.?\\n\\n7.14pm BST\\n19:14\\n\\nNow Bruce Fromong is speaking. He says first and forement he?s not only here as Simpson?s friend of almost 27 years, but he?s also appearing as a victim of a crime. He believes Simpson was misguided on the date of the crime, that he was misled about what was going to be there that day. He was promised family photos, family heirlooms, possibly his ex-wife?s engagement ring, when in reality it was mostly football memorabilia. He admits there were items in that room that were stolen from Simpson, but he insists that he never stole anything from OJ. (A point on which Simpson appears to agree.)?I will make this clear to you: OJ never held a gun on me,? Fromong says. ?There was a coward in that room, a man named McClinton, who came up gangster-style. He held the gun on me. Not OJ. Another man came in, hit me. Not OJ, he never laid a hand on me.?\\n\\n7.07pm BST\\n19:07\\n\\nSimpson?s attorney?s second point focuses on the amends that Simpson has made with Bruce Fromong, one of the two robbery victims (and the only one still living). Fromong will testify next, but Simpson will make his closing statement first.?I am sorry the things turned out the way they did,? Simpson says in his final statement to the board. ?I had no intention to commit a crime.?\\n\\n6.59pm BST\\n18:59\\n\\nLaVergne says this letter, which he claims he?s reading without Simpson?s knowledge, proves Simpson?s positive intentions and represents ?the definiton of character?: that Simpson had a friend suddenly in a position of power but he refused to use it to try and get better treatment or an early release. That?s the first part of LaVergne?s closing remarks, he says. \\n\\n6.57pm BST\\n18:57\\n\\nBisbee now tells Simpson?s attorney Malcolm LaVergne that it?s time for closing statements. He reads a letter written by Simpson to Nevada state Assemblyman Osvaldo Fumo, the full text of which appears below.This is the letter #OJSimpson's attorney is referring to. @8NewsNow pic.twitter.com/YsYa8WeH5t\\n\\n6.52pm BST\\n18:52\\n\\nArnelle Simpson, OJ?s oldest child, is now speaking on his behalf: ?No one really knows how much we?ve been through.?She says the family realizes he?s not perfect but has done the best he can and acknowledges he didn?t make the right decision in 2008 when he tried to take back his property.Updated\\nat 7.01pm BST\\n\\n\\n6.49pm BST\\n18:49\\n\\nIndeed, Endel is wearing a Kansas City Chiefs tie.\\n\\n6.42pm BST\\n18:42\\n\\nEndel asks how he?d anticipate dealing with public scrutiny if released. Simpson says he?s been recognized publicly ?since I was 19? and is more than used to it. He says even in the two decades since his double-murder trial, he rarely encounteres negativity on the streets and has remained as appraochable as ever.\\n\\n6.41pm BST\\n18:41\\n\\nAdam Endel, another parole commissioner, asks whether he?s completed his restitution payments to the victims. After a bit of a confusion, Simpson confirms he has. Endel then asks why parole would be better for Simpson than completing his sentence in Lovelock. Simpson says he?s been denied time with his four kids long enough: ?I?ve served my time. ... I?ve not complained for nine years. All I?ve done is try to be helpful.?He says he?s received many interview requests and job offers from media and turned them all down. Endel asks if Simpson emphasizes that any violation of his parole, if it?s granted, would result in his returning to prison: ?I?ve never lived a criminal life. I?m a pretty straight shooter.?\\n\\n6.37pm BST\\n18:37\\n\\n?I haven?t made any excuses in nine years here,? Simpson says. ?But I should have never let these security guys try to help when they were only trying to help themselves.?Jackson says they?ve received hundreds of letters of support and hundreds of letters against his release. Most of the latter group, Jackson says, have begged the board to consider Simpson?s criminial trial in the 1994 murders of his ex-wife and her friend and subsequent civil judgment against Simpson. Jackson confirms what we already knew: the board will not considered either of these factors in their decision. Simpson somewhat meekly shrugs his shoulders in consent. \\n\\n6.34pm BST\\n18:34\\n\\nSimpson is asked whether these courses, including a computer course, will help his re-adjustment to the world. ?I?m not a guy who has conflicts on the street,? Simpson says. ?I?m a guy who?s got along with just about everybody.?\\n\\n6.31pm BST\\n18:31\\n\\nCorn asks another question: ?What do you think the impact was on your victims?? Simpson says he knows what the impact was, but re-emphasizes that no one ever accused him of pulling a weapon on them.Now Susan Jackson, another parole commissioner, asks about his commitment to Christianity and how he started a Baptist ministy in prison. He then tells Jackson about the various courses he?s complete in prison, inclduing courses in Alternative to Violence and Victim Empathy. He admits that he ?had a few drinks? on the day of the robbery because they were celebrating a wedding, but he never had a substance abuse issue. Jackson says that she asks the question because he promised the parole board in 2013 that he?d attend Alcoholics Anonymous, which he hasn?t done. Simpson says he never had a problem and believed that his initiative with the Baptist prayer group and role as commissioner of an 18-team softball league compensates for the exprience he?d have had in AA.\\n\\n6.22pm BST\\n18:22\\n\\n... Simpson?s voice raises as he goes deeper into his account: ?It?s been ruled legally by the state of California that the property was mine.? He finds it unfair that he?s in jall for going to retrieve property that courts ultimately found was rightfully his. He says he didn?t realize guns were brandished in the hotel room until after they were back in the car driving back to their hotel.\\n\\n6.19pm BST\\n18:19\\n\\nThe former NFL star explains he was contacted by a man who offered photographs of the sports memorabilia that OJ immediately recognized as personal belongings, including his mother?s photo album and personal letters. By chance, ?a perfect storm? as Simpson called it, they all ended up in Las Vegas at the same time. The people who had the memorabilia were former friends of OJ, he explains, who had actually helped him move the stuff into storage before. He continues to tell how the scheme to retrieve the property unfolded, nothing that?s not already in the public record. He emphasizes that he had no weapon. (Remember: The four other men who accompanied Simpson, including two who testified that they carried guns, accepted plea deals in the heist and received probation.)He continues ... \\n\\n6.11pm BST\\n18:11\\n\\nSimpson is asked whether the first time he was arrested was after the age of 24. He admits he was arrested for the first time ?when I was 46 or 47?. We all know what that was for.Bisbee says he?s had a substance abuse issue and that Simpson is male. Then she says that Simpson is ?90 years old? and both rooms erupt in laugher. OJ, of course, is 70. She corrects her error with a smile. He has stable post-release plans and no gang affiliations.Bisbee says these factors make Simpson a low risk, but the violent nature of the offense will force the board consider factors, both aggravating and mitigating.\\n\\n6.07pm BST\\n18:07\\n\\n?Mr Simpson, you are getting the same hearing that everybody else gets,? Bisbee says, prompting a hint of laughter from Simpson and his attorney, but adds that she will be adding more information than necessary due to the excessive amount of media interest in the case. Bisbee goes into the explaining the detailed risk assessment used by Nevada to determine the prisoner?s likelihood of committing another crime: ?It?s pretty darn predictive is the bottom line here.?\\n\\n6.05pm BST\\n18:05\\n\\nConnie Bisbee, one of the four parole commissioners, starts off the hearing at 10:01am local time by calling for Simpson, who will be joined by one of his representatives. And here?s OJ, who, as previous reports have indicated, has indeed lost a considerable amount of weight. He?s wearing his blue prisoner uniform and joined by his attorney.

Most of these are expected to align in Simpson?s favor. Remember: the same four commissioners for todays hearing already granted Simpson parole on the lesser charges of kidnapping, robbery and burglary in a July 2013 hearing.One factor that won?t be considered is Simpson?s trial (and ultimate acquittal) in the 1994 killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman.\\n\\n5.36pm BST\\n17:36\\n\\nOJ Simpson, a/k/a inmate No1027820, is scheduled to appear before the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners today for a hearing that will determine whether one of America?s most notorious prisoners will be released after serving nine years of a 33-year sentence for convictions related to a 2007 kidnapping and armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel.The hearing is slated to begin at 10pm local time (1pm ET/6pm BST) or just about 25 minutes from now. Here?s a general idea of what to expect:The release of Simpson, now 70, would no doubt kick off a renewed media frenzy that?s been suggested in the days leading up to today?s hearing, which will be broadcast live nationally on ESPN.

The disgraced gridiron hero, with the help of several other accomplices, broke into a Las Vegas hotel room on 13 September 2007 and held up two memorabilia dealers for collectibles and personal items he claimed were rightfully his. He was found guilty by a jury on all 12 charges and given the maximum sentence.Four members from the Nevada board of parole commissioners will consider parole for Simpson at the board offices in Carson City in a hearing scheduled for 10am PT. Simpson will participate by video conference from about 100 miles away at Lovelock correctional center, the Pershing County prison where he has been incarcerated since December 2008.The same four commissioners already granted Simpson parole on the lesser charges of kidnapping, robbery and burglary in a July 2013 hearing. That ruling left Simpson with four years remaining before reaching the minimum sentence of nine years.The rate of inmates who are granted parole in discretionary hearings held as they approach their minimum sentence is around 82%.\", 'Justice (retired) Leila Seth, mother of noted author Vikram Seth and first woman judge of Delhi High Court, has passed away.

This was largely due to fewer attacks and deaths in Afghanistan, Syria, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Yemen.?The observations on Pakistan were almost the same as observations in the country reports for 2015, for instance, reflecting a continuity from the previous Obama administration that had in August 2016 punished Pakistan for its patchy counter-terrorism by withholding $300 million in defence aid.Earlier that year, the US Senate had come together in a bipartisan effort to kill a proposal for a subsidised sale of eight new F-17 combat jets to Pakistan for exactly the same reason ? not acting resolutely enough against terrorists based on its soil.The Trump administration has already indicated its views on Pakistan?s counter-terrorism efforts are no different. National Security Adviser HR McMaster delivered that message directly to the Pakistani leadership during a visit to Islamabad in April, emphasising ?the need to confront terrorism in all its forms?.President Donald Trump has personally not weighed in on this yet, but his remarks on Twitter from 2012 may point to his thinking: ?Get it straight.

A military court finally gave her justice.Squadron Leader JM Lowe was a test pilot in the Air Force on deputation with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and died on June 19, 1962 in a flying accident. His widow with her four-year-old child had been fighting since then for the dues.THE INCIDENTThe accident occurred 55 years ago in Bengaluru while the pilot was test-flying the Gnat aircraft, which developed severe mechanical failure witnessed as \"violent pitch oscillations\" prior to delivery to the IAF.\"Despite the fact that the officer\\'s widow is entitled to special family pension, the government in September 2004 rejected her appeal by giving an illogical reason that under the terms of deputation the applicant had already availed the benefits of insurance,\" Lowe\\'s counsel Wing Commander Ajay Bhalla told Mail Today.Kamla Lowe also had to wait nine years for getting the ordinary pension and had to suffer a lot because of the lack of it, her husband\\'s case revealed.The lady had also been fruitlessly writing letters to various authorities concerned to get her dues from the government.The government countered her by saying that she could not be given the special pension as her husband had opted for an insurance scheme before his death and also opposed the plea in the Armed Forces Tribunal, saying that she had come for justice after 55 years and her plea should dismissed on the basis of delay in approaching the court.The government also told the court that finding papers of the family pension granted to the widow of the officer and documents related to his deputation to HAL also could not be found as the matter was very old.\"Pained\" by the sufferings of the IAF officer\\'s widow, the tribunal bench headed by Chairperson Justice Virendra Singh said, \"Apart from the awful trauma of losing her husband, and having to bring up her four-year-old child, all alone, we observe that for almost nine years this widow was not even granted the basic right of ordinary family pension.\" The chairperson in his order said the terms and conditions of that insurance (opted for by the martyred pilot) \"are not before us\".\"However, it would be pertinent to mention that no insurance scheme can take away the right of pension of a serviceman, and therefore, consequently the widow,\" he said.The court said the government has to deal fairly with its workforce as \"employees cannot be asked to sign undertakings contrary to law.\"Ruling in favour of the elderly lady, the court said, \"We find no impediment in the applicant being granted Special Family Pension as prayed for.

Rai is the crucial link in the case which led to the arrest of Indrani Mukerjea, her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna for the murder of Sheena.Rai has given the police a detailed account of how Indrani, along with Khanna conspired to eliminate Sheena, and how the three of them executed the plot. In his confession, Rai said Indrani contacted him towards the end of March 2012, through her personal assistant Kajal Sharma. He said Indrani had spoken to him on Skype and revealed her plans to eliminate her two children ? Sheena and Mikhail and asked for his help.He said Indrani wanted to kill both of them because they were maligning her image in society and threatened to expose the truth that she was their mother and not their sister as she had been claiming.

And though malnourishment related deaths have been reported from across the state she refused to attribute even a single death to malnourishment.\"Technically It is impossible to answer how many children died because of malnourishment because children died because of various disease which could have resulted from malnourishment. But I can tell you as far as malnourishment figures are concerned we have improved on all parameters,\" Archana Chitnis said while talking to India Today.Children have died across the state but we chose to do a reality check in Satna where according to the minister\\'s reply 2167 children below the age of 6 have died due to various reasons. Majhagava block is the worst affected where around 1000 malnourished kids who have been admitted to the rehabilitation centres set up by the government. Many deaths have been reported from the 19 odd tribal dominated villages that fall in this block but the government is not willing to accept malnourishment and severe malnourishment as the cause.Leader of opposition Ajay Singh however attributes corruption as the cause behind the rising deaths of infants in Madhya Pradesh. \"Satna is there, also Chitrakoot is there and in Majhgava block there is severe malnourishment. The reason behind this is corruption. Those who are supposed to supply nutritional food are associated with the BJP and till the time this cartel is broken malnourishment cannot be tackled in Madhya Pradesh,\" he told India Today.If we break down the annual death figure of 28948 into days a shocking statistic stares at your face. 79 children aged below six years die every day in Madhya Pradesh and this shows that the infant mortality rate in Madhya Pradesh is worse than even many African nations.

How has it been received in Pakistan?A good product is well-received everywhere. People here in Pakistan have loved the film and are ecstatic about the collaboration between the two nations.Tragically, you and Sajal Ali could not be a part of the film?s promotion and release... Tell me your honest and deepest thoughts on not being able to be in Mumbai for the opening of your film?Obviously, it is a sad feeling when you are not able to promote a project you have spent tiring days and nights working on. But then you are relieved that the promotion lies in more than capable hands, for the likes of Sridevi and Nawaazuddin Siddiqui and Akshaye Khanna.Before you, Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan could not be in India for the release of their big films. How do you look at this situation where artistes from Pakistan are being left out of their moment of glory? Is there a growing sense of resentment among Pakistani artistes for this state of isolation?I wouldn?t go as far as saying there?s resentment to this situation. But I would agree it is hurting the relations between artists of both the countries. The politics may steer a situation in any direction but the people of both countries love and respect art for what it is. They don?t see passports when they purchase a ticket, they see a film.Political relations between the two countries have deteriorated to such an extent that cultural ties are also threatened now. What do you feel about the impasse between the two countries and how it can be resolved?No matter how hard people try, our cultural ties will come out strong. We share more than just the colour of our skins, we share history, we share values, we share customs and it is just a matter of time we will start sharing our artists, directors, writers, technicians on a large scale too. I honestly believe we can find peace in art.In fact, you have produced a TV series on Hindus in Pakistan and have constantly championed India-Pakistan peace. Is that hard to do when hostility seems fashionable?No, it isn?t. As I said, people of the both countries are smart enough not get themselves into politically incorrect situations. My production of Seeta Bagri was extremely well perceived and people in Pakistan supported its message of tolerance and brotherhood.How did you decide to work in Mom? And was it difficult to shoot for the film with growing political hostilities between the two countries?Once I got the offer, I couldn?t resist myself from saying yes since, I knew, I would be playing a role against Sridevi and I was also aware that Sajal Aly from Pakistan, who is a beautiful actor, is part of the cast. The political hostility as you say did create hurdles for the film. However, it was Boney Kapoor Saab who became the leader and crisis-breaker, sorted out the production issues and took us all home for a win.Adnan Siddiqui is known for his roles on TV.You are a known face and name in India, thanks to your wonderful television serials which have amply demonstrated your range. Tell us about your experience of becoming a television star before capturing cinema?My journey in the media industry started with my modeling career and it took off with a casual role in a drama serial. People were extremely kind in accepting me as an actor when I knew nothing and since then, I am trying to prove to them, my fans, that they were right about me.Does the film industry in your country offer you enough opportunities as an actor?The New Cinema, as I like to call it, is a growing baby. There are a lot of players with growing ambitions, hence, it is creating opportunities all across the board which is a beautiful sight. However, since it is an evolving industry, we will need time to eradicate the mistakes and enhance the strengths.Follow @htshowbiz for more', 'If some unscrupulous elements in the prosthetic industry have their way, voter fraud could soon go out of hand, literally.A discreet investigation by India Today has unearthed a ring of prosthetic suppliers who, by their own admission on camera, are selling silicone fingers to political parties trying to rig UP elections.Demands for their wares have shot up, they revealed, with leaders ordering them in bulk for their teams to cast multiple votes by masking their fingers bearing the indelible ink-mark with prostheses.Regarded as a badge of democratic privilege, the finger dye prevents voters from re-voting.

The law also imposes financial sanctions against Iran and North Korea.Trump said the law will ?punish and deter bad behavior by the rogue regimes in Tehran and Pyongyang? and enhance existing sanctions on Moscow.The president had been reluctant to proceed with the bill, even after it was revised to include some changes that American and European companies sought to ensure that business deals were not stifled by new sanctions. Trump has expressed frustration over Congress? ability to limit or override the power of the White House on national security matters, saying that it is complicating efforts to coordinate with allies ? a sentiment he expressed in Wednesday?s statement.Last week, the House overwhelmingly backed the bill, 419-3, and the Senate rapidly followed its lead on a 98-2 vote. Those margins guaranteed that Congress would be able to beat back any attempt by Trump to veto the measure.The president said Wednesday that he signed the bill ?for the sake of national unity.??The bill remains seriously flawed ? particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch?s authority to negotiate,? Trump said. ?By limiting the executive?s flexibility, this bill makes it harder for the United States to strike good deals for the American people, and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together.?MORE: Full statement - @W7VOA pic.twitter.com/haHU4cAg7i? Conflict News (@Conflicts) August 2, 2017Trump?s talk of extending a hand of cooperation to Russian President Vladimir Putin has been met with resistance as skeptical lawmakers look to limit his leeway. The new measure targets Russia?s energy sector as part of legislation that prevents Trump from easing sanctions on Moscow without congressional approval.Those limits, backed by Republicans as well as Democrats, resulted from lawmakers? worries that Trump might ease the financial hits without first securing concessions from Putin. Republicans refused to budge even after the White House complained that the ?congressional review? infringed on Trump?s executive authority.Moscow responded to a White House announcement last week that Trump intended to sign the bill, ordering a reduction in the number of U.S. diplomats in Russia.Top members of Trump?s administration voiced their unhappiness with the bill anew this week, echoing his sentiments that it poses more diplomatic hindrances than solutions.?Neither the president nor I are very happy about that,? Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday of the sanctions bill, which he had urged lawmakers not to approve.?We were clear that we didn?t think that was going to be helpful to our efforts, but that?s the decision they made,? he said.Tillerson conceded that he is unable to show that the US has fulfilled Trump?s objective of a new, more cooperative relationship between the former Cold War foes, noting only modest efforts in Syria as a sign the nations share some common goals. While he said Americans want the US to get along with the nuclear-armed power, he did not address other concerns at home. US intelligence agencies have accused Moscow of meddling in the 2016 presidential election to help Trump.?The situation is bad, but believe me ? it can get worse,? Tillerson said.Vice President Mike Pence, traveling Tuesday in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, sought to reframe the sanctions as a ?further sign of our commitment? to counter Russian aggression in the region.?The president and our Congress are unified in our message to Russia: A better relationship, the lifting of sanctions will require Russia to reverse the actions that caused the sanctions to be imposed in the first place,? Pence said. ?And not before.?Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle celebrated the passage of the sanctions bill.?It?s long overdue,? Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said of Trump?s decision to sign the bill nearly a week after it cleared Congress. ?Hope we?ll send again a strong message to Russia that we can?t have interference in our elections going forward.?Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he hadn?t read the statement Trump issued announcing that he?d signed the sanctions bill. But Corker, who shepherded the legislation through the Senate, appeared indifferent to Trump?s criticisms. ?Somebody pointed it out,? Corker said exiting the Senate chamber after a vote. ?That?s fine.?', 'Delhi residents can now avail free MRI, PET and CT scans at 21 private laboratories.

After shelling out Rs 3 lakh, when she sought more time to arrange the rest, the couple asked her to let them live in peace.The police have registered an FIR against the duo for rape and criminal intimidation.WHAT HAPPENEDThe 29-year-old victim is based in Chattisgarh and runs an apparel store. She met accused Ajay Gupta through an online portal where she had posted her number to promote her business. They started talking and grew close.The woman, who had just entered into the apparel business, decided to come to Delhi for purchases on the suggestion of the accused. She alleged that Ajay had sex with her after putting sindoor (vermilion) on her forehead and told her that he will apply for court marriage.However, after returning to Chattisgarh she learnt that Ajay was married and had two kids. \"Ajay told me that he was fed up with his marriage and wanted to marry me. I tried consoling him and said that he can take a decision and let me know. A while later, I received a call from his alleged estranged wife Uma Gupta who said that even she was fed up with her husband and had no problem with the two of us getting married,\" the victim told Mail Today.She was asked to pay Rs 6 lakh to the wife first, only after which the marriage could take place.\"I agreed to this condition.

The competition appeal tribunal (CAT), a newly empowered court that oversees Britain?s fledgling class action regime, ruled that it would not grant the necessary collective proceedings order for the case to continue to trial. Had it been allowed to proceed, the case would have been the largest and most complex in British legal history and would have tested the limits of the new Consumer Rights Act, which introduced US-style ?opt-out? collective class actions for breaches of UK or European Union competition law in 2015. MasterCard welcomed the judgment, saying the claim was ?completely unsuitable? to be brought under the collective action regime.A law firm, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, launched the case on behalf of adults in Britain after MasterCard lost a drawn-out appeal against a 2007 European commission decision that ruled its fees were anti-competitive. The case centred on so-called interchange fees, the charges levied by credit and debit card companies such as MasterCard on merchants? banks, which card companies say cover the costs of operating card services, security and innovation. It alleged these fees were a significant cost for retailers and were passed on through increased prices of goods and services to all UK consumers, including those who paid in cash and not just MasterCard holders. London-based Walter Merricks, a lawyer who once led the Financial Ombudsman Service group that handles consumer disputes with banks and who is the representative named on the proposed action, said he was considering an appeal with his advisers. ?The new collective action regime was introduced by the Consumer Rights Act to overcome the difficulty for consumers seeking to recover losses from competition law infringements,? he said. ?I am concerned that this new regime, designed to benefit consumers, may never get off the ground.? He added that concerns cited by the tribunal, which included the difficulties in providing evidence that MasterCard fees were passed on to consumers and in precisely calculating individual losses for so many consumers, could have been overcome. The planned lawsuit had been dubbed by one lawyer the ?perfect exam question? for Britain?s CAT, nominated in 2015 to oversees the country?s maiden ?opt-out? class action lawsuits in antitrust cases. Under the regime, UK-based members of a defined group are automatically bound into legal action unless they opt out. Critics say such regimes encourage claims without merit. But others argue they are designed to offer a more effective and economic route to compensation for UK-based consumers and businesses that fall victim to anti-competitive conduct and saves on hefty advertising costs to rally a large group together.The high court ruled in January that MasterCard had charged interchange fees at a lawful level and without restricting competition in a similar dispute with retailers. ', 'In an unfortunate series of events that unfolded in the Kashmir Valley in the aftermath of the India-Pakistan tie in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 at Edgbaston that left the neighbours\\' nose bloodied, pro-Kashmir elements hacked the official website of the premier National Institute of Technology (NIT) based in Srinagar on Monday, calling for an Azaad Kashmir.NIT Srinagar became a target perhaps for the fact that it had hit headlines after a clash between Kashmiri and non-Kashmiri students last year when the latter cheered India\\'s defeat in the T20 World Cup match against West Indies. The servers were downed after the attack.While the nation was busy grappling with an early-morning terrorist attack on a CRPF station at Sumbal in Bandipora district of Kashmir, which was foiled by jawans and left four terrorists dead, pro-Kashmir freedom elements, most probably from across the border, hacked the website of the premier institute and posted, \"Ask for milk, we shall give you sweets. Ask for Kashmir we shall kill you.\" This, ironically, has been the clarion call of the Right wing, which it employs towards those asking for Kashmir\\'s freedom.\"We saw that the website had been hacked when some students tried to access it to see a few articles of the syllabus.

The department has invited suggestions and objections on the rules in a month. Lakhs of illegal structures or unauthorised buildings, largely residential ones including those like the controversial Campa Cola compound in Worli, now stand to benefit from this policy. A senior urban development official said, ?We have formulated the rules mainly keeping residential structures in mind. Within six months of the rules coming into force, planning authorities will have to invite applications from owners and occupiers for consideration of cases for regularisation. The local authority will specify the time and date for the submission of such cases, after which applications will not be considered. The authority will then take a call on the cases as per the rules.?The official said even a case like the controversial Campa Cola compound in Worli stands to benefit if they have purchased the required Floor Space Index (FSI). FSI refers to the ratio of the built-up area to the plot area and indicates the permissible construction limit. The seven buildings in the Campa Cola compound have 35 floors more than what was approved by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), prompting the civic body to send a demolition notice leading to a long protracted legal battle.To pave the way for the regularisation of such structures, the state government passed a bill to amend the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act in the budget session of the legislature in April this year. The move will bring relief to lakhs of citizens in such buildings in places such as Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Navi Mumbai and Pimpri Chinchwad. However, it is also likely to set a precedent and open the decks for further condoning of illegal construction in the future.According to the draft rules, the state?s policy will apply to most cases of unauthorised construction, except for structures in ecologically sensitive zones, Coastal Regulation Zones, land meant for playgrounds or parks, heritage buildings and structurally unsafe buildings, among others.For cases of FSI violations, such as Campa Cola, the draft rules state such construction can be considered for regularisation by procuring premium or fungible FSI, or Transfer of Development Rights, as per applicable norms. Owners or occupants of such structures will have to pay compounding charges at 10 percent of land rate over and above the premium for the extra FSI.Similarly, the draft rules will also allow regularising construction where the structure is taller than the maximum height allowed as per the width of the road it abuts. While local authorities will have to explore the option of road widening in such cases, the state?s draft rules allow them to consider regularisation of the unauthorised construction by levying a compounding fee of 10 percent of the ready reckoner rates.The draft rules also provide for compounding fees for regularisation in case of inadequate setback area, violations in ground coverage, parking, staircase, passage width and misuse of any such free of FSI components. Moreover, building owner or occupants will need to procure the required no-objection certificates from departments such as drainage, water supply, fire, structural stability certificates and so on before regularisation.Once a civic body declares a structure as a compounded structure for regularisation, no further development will be allowed on the plot besides regular maintenance and repairs or redevelopment as per norms.The state government has instructed civic bodies to keep aside all the money collected as compounding fees under these rules for providing public amenities, utilities and services in the respective areas.Read more:Lakhs of illegal structures across Maharashtra to be regularised after penalties', 'The Shailendra Singh diet is not for everyone.

And this is not the first, but the seventh submarine to be deployed in the area.The submarine is being supported by Chinese Naval Ship (CNS) Chongmingdao - the Chinese Navy\\'s submarine support vessel. Indian assets picked up the submarine entering the Indian Ocean Region recently.The Indian Navy has underlined the heightened Chinese People\\'s Liberation Navy activity in the Indian Ocean Region to South Block.

', 'swapnil.rawal@hindustantimes.comThe Shiv Sena launched yet another scathing attack on its ally the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through its mouthpiece Saamana on Sunday. In an interview to the newspaper, party chief Uddhav Thackeray attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of ?centralising? power.In a chat with Sena Member of Parliament and executive editor of Saamana Sanjay Raut, Thackeray attacked Modi over his style of functioning, demonetisation, Good and Services Tax (GST) and the PM?s poll pitch ?acche din?. ?The ?acche din? are only limited to government advertisement; the ground reality is completely different. Do we have true democracy in the country if all affairs are going to be run according to the wishes of the Prime Minister? He is centralising power, instead of decentralising it. He is taking away the independence of the states,? Thackeray said.Thackeray, who has been a staunch critic of demonetisation, said the move has not yielded anything positive, instead, it has affected the livelihood of people. ?Around 15 lakh people lost their jobs because of demonetisation. This means around 60 lakh people were directly affected. You should give them jobs now. How are you going to balance ?Start-up India?, ?Make in India? programmes with such colossal job losses? ? Thackeray asked.He also slammed the state government over the farm loan waiver. Thackeray said the government should table the list of 36 lakh farmers, who were going to get the benefit of the waiver in the upcoming Monsoon session. He said the party would continue its ?dhol bajao andolan? (protest by beating drums) to turn the heat on the government over implementing the loan waiver.Interestingly, the Sena chief said he shares a cordial relationship with Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. ?There was no personal animosity between me and the current chief minister. My relation with him is really good. Often, he has accepted the suggestions I have given. He is putting forward views of his party, I am representing the people of the state. The difference is only that,? he said.The two parties share an uncomfortable relationship ever since 2014 Assembly polls where they contested independently. Earlier in 2017, the BJP and the Sena parted ways for the Mumbai civic elections. Sena, which is the junior partner in the central and state governments, has never missed an opportunity to speak up against the BJP and the prime minister. Reiterating his stand, Thackeray said he and his party will continue to speak up whenever they disagree with the decision of the BJP in the state and at the Centre. ?I want to explain my stand here. Whenever I say something or Sena speaks, we are considered anti-government. I am not anti-government. I am merely on the side of the people,? he said.', 'Switching off lights and electrical appliances during the Earth Hour initiative this year, Delhi saved around 290 MW of power, the capital\\'s distribution companies (discoms) announced on Sunday.The global Earth Hour initiative aimed at energy conservation was observed between 8:30 pm and 9:30 pm on Saturday.\"This is more than last year when Delhi had saved around 230 MW,\" a spokesperson of power major BSES said here.

BJP national president Amit Shah was addressing the \\'illegal\\' meeting wherein Chief Minister Manohar Parikkar was also present. Not only is congregation of people barred outside airports but it is also against rules laid down by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. However, the public meeting was organised at the Goa International Airport. Chairs were arranged, speakers were put in place and the dais was ready before Amit Shah\\'s arrival, around 11 am. All arrangements were made even as Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is entrusted with security of all Indian Airports, allegedly behaved indifferently.Union minister Sripad Naik, local party chief Vinay Tendulkar and minister Mauvin Godinho were present in the public meeting. At least a few hundred people assembled in thE limited periphery right outside the Dabolim airport. ACTIVISTS DEMANDS AN FIR BE FILEDThis prompted lawyer and activist Aires Rodrigues to formally put forward a complaint with the Secretary of Civil Aviation, Chief Secretary of Goa as well as the DGP of the state. In a very strongly worded letter that India Today is in exclusive possession of, Rodrigues wrote, \"It constitutes act of unlawful assembly as defined in section 141 (IPC) by which not only mischief has been caused but also other people who were arriving at or departing from the airport, were restrained by the blockage due to the public meeting\".Rodrigues not only demanded that an FIR be registered against the organisers but also all dignitaries including Amit Shah. He also demanded action against the public servants responsible for the security of the area for dereliction of duty. Though no official statement has come so far from the Bharatiya Janata Party, the state Congress was quick to hit out calling it \\'abuse of power\\'.', 'Asked what he plans to do when he leaves the presidency, Vladimir Putin paused and smiled. ?But I haven?t decided yet if I will leave the presidency,? the Russian leader replied, to laughter and applause from an audience made up almost entirely of Russians who were born after he first became president in 2000.A month after thousands of young Russians took to the streets to protest against corruption among the Kremlin elite, Putin held a set-piece discussion event on Friday with hundreds of children, in an apparent attempt to portray himself as a youth-friendly president. Presidential elections will take place next March and Putin is widely expected to stand and win another six-year term. An opposition politician, Alexei Navalny, who organised the recent round of protests, has said he would like to stand but his name is unlikely to be allowed on the ballot paper.Putin spent three hours speaking with the assembled children, in a session broadcast live on Russian television. Those present appeared to have been screened to ensure there would be no hostile questions. The discussion took place at Sirius, a school in Sochi for gifted children, which Putin opened several years ago. The tone of the discussion was set by the first question, when Putin was thanked for backing the school and for giving opportunities to so many children. ?I can also tell you that I even thought up the name: Sirius,? said Putin, to prolonged applause.Sitting in an open-necked white shirt, with hundreds of schoolchildren arranged in circles around him, Putin took questions from those present and at times picked out cards with pre-written questions on them in a game-show-style format.Unlike Putin?s press conferences and phone-ins with the nation, which usually vary across a range of topics from foreign policy to the minutiae of regional problems, his discussion with the children was divided between talk about their own achievements in sport, music and science, and questions about Putin?s personal life and preferences.?I like chatting with my friends, reading historical books, listening to music and doing sport,? said Putin when asked what he does in his spare time. At times, Putin was in philosophical mood, answering questions about the three values that are most important to him in life (?love, freedom and life itself?) and when asked what his childhood dream was, he declined to say but dispensed some life advice: ?You know, dreams are things that change over time. You should instead be happy that you have a dream and you should make strides towards it.?Asked whether he used the internet, Putin said almost never but said the way people use nicknames and fake identities online was quite similar to how he had adopted false identities during his work for the KGB.There was very little discussion of politics and no mention of Navalny?s investigations into corruption among Putin?s inner circle, which were the motivation for the recent protests. The one nod to the recent events was a softball question asking what Putin thought of opposition politicians. The president, who has never uttered Navalny?s name in public, said merely that in Ukraine people had used anti-corruption slogans to get into power and now the country was even more corrupt. The discussion quickly moved on, with a synchronised skating team telling Putin it was their dream to have a photograph with him on ice: Putin said he would be happy to oblige.Major foreign policy questions were also absent from the discussion and there was no talk of the alleged Russian interference in the US elections or Putin?s recent meeting with Donald Trump at the G20 summit. Indeed, the only American mentioned during the long discussion was Oliver Stone, the film director who made a four-hour documentary about the Russian president, which was criticised in some quarters for being too soft on the president. Putin said he really liked the ?extraordinary? Stone, though admitted he had fallen asleep while trying to watch the film.', \"News just came in that superstar Rajinikanth has reportedly expressed his keenness to join politics and launch his own party. But, on Wednesday, when India Today asked Rajinikanth's contemporary actor and superstar Kamal Haasan on his political aspirations, the answer came as a brutal shock to many.In the interview to India Today's Rajdeep Sardesai, Haasan expressed extreme anger on the rampant corruption in Tamil Nadu politics for the last 60 years and the current uncertainty over leadership between VK Sasikala and O Panneerselvam. Here's an excerpt from the conversation:Rajdeep Sardesai:Â\\xa0 You have been direct. You are making it clear to the people of Tamil Nadu that Mr O Panneerselvam is not incompetent, and should be given a chance. If he is proven incompetent, people can throw him out. In that respect, Sasikala should respect the will of Tamil Nadu rather than imposing her will?Kamal Haasan: Absolutely, even I cannot, with all my connection to television channel, impose my will. I can speak what I think, but can't impose. I may be proven wrong, but I must speak now.Q: Do you believe the people of Tamil Nadu has been ill-served byÂ\\xa0 the political class which needs to recognise the needs and aspirations of the people?A: Let us not get carried away by nostalgia. Tamil Nadu has not had the best of service from politicians for more than 60 years now. The first 10 years were glorious, but Congress..Kamraj-ji, Raja-ji.. they all became complacent. Then came the Dravidian parties. Those promises were also not kept. It's sort of churning into a quagmire now.Q: In this quagmire, at the moment do you the best interest of Tamil Nadu is with Panneerselvam and not Sasikala?Â\\xa0 That Sasikala, by virtue of the fact that she was close to Jayalalithaa cannot use that as a reason? Do you believe she's not qualified enough to become the chief minister at this point?A: I don't think it is right on the people, I don't know what her qualifications are. Neither do the people. And sticking around somebody for long enough doesn't make you qualified enough for the profession. Am a lawyer's son, that doesn't mean I can go to the court and argue a case. Am an actor. I trained for that. ..The time of dice playing was done with in Mahabharat. We can't be playing dice and hawking our family wives and lives, in favour of some numbers [Sasikala's MLA support]. We don't trade. We are the people.Q: You feel let down today. I see in your voice, a sense of frustration and a sense of almost being betrayed by the political class of Tamil Nadu?A: For how long? I've known betrayal only from the time I have been a boy. And one reason for another is not big enough for me. They keep saying, this is the reason, we could have done it, that's not good enough reason. Show me results, show me roads, clean my rivers. You have done nothing. We have two gutters running around Chennai, we started with rivers a 100 years back. Starting from simple sanitation.Q: Do you believe that because of what you call the conglomeration of corruption, the politicians of Tamil Nadu have distanced themselves from people and people's issues.A: Absolutely. It happened to the Congress when they thought they got the freedom for the country, and people as if they owe each other something. It's not true. Results are to be seen for us let them continue. We could have done so many things with just 5 years years you promised. We wasted half a century and more on improving a state. If this is just the state of a state, what have we done to the country?Q: I sense in you a potential budding politician. You say only do politics till they put a black ink on your finger. But in this anger and frustration, I sense someone who could become a politician if you chose to?

The age that Alia is today, I had made a film on female infanticide. It won a National Award. But the audience hardly came to watch the film in the theatres. Then I made Zakhm, again a sensitive movie based on my father?s real life story, was a box office disaster. Not a single person went to watch it in the theatres. It is not that it didn?t have star value. It had names like Ajay Devgn, Nagarjuna, Pooja Bhatt and Mahesh Bhatt. But that failed to get the audience to buy the tickets. Then I made Jism. The business of Jism is more than the collective business off Zakhm, Tamanna, Dushman, Sur all put together.?India pretends concerns, but watches something else. It is people who made Jism run to packed houses. Just as if a magazine is not getting readers, you need to tweak it to suite their taste, eventually, with movies it?s about business and people will only put money in something that will yield profit,? she says.And she has taken her lessons from one of the best in the business, her father, Mahesh Bhatt. ?My father always says that there are two kinds of cinema. One that you make to jolt the audience and the other is the kind you make to soothe the jolted. Eighty per cent of India lives below the poverty line and they want escapism. And there is the elite intellectual audience who goes to the cinemas in the fine saris and gold and they want to see the other side - the darker side that has poverty and diseases. So it depends on who you choose to cater to.?Pooja is of the opinion that neither of the two is inferior as each fulfils the need of one set of audience. ?To me, a Dabangg is as relevant as a Masaan. I loved both films, each appealed to a different sensibility in me. I am a commercial filmmaker and I make no bones about that. At the end of the day I want people to watch my films. I am not interested in making movies that only 10 people will watch and will get critical appreciation at some festival.?Also, Jism is a film she stands by. ?It was the first true adult film of our times. For a change, it was about a strong woman talking about her sexual needs . Unlike the sex comedies today, it had no double entendre, no bad jokes, nothing. It was a movie made by adults, for adults. When sex is regarded as a bad word, the society starts to rot from inside. ?The definition of a b***h nowadays is that you know your mind and are unafraid to state it,? says Pooja. ?By that logic, I am certainly a b***h. For I certainly know what I want. More than that, I know what I don?t want. And so did my heroine in Jism.?

Consequently, the notice is stayed till further order of this court,? the High Curt said. The commission had directed the secretary of the club to appear in person before it on July 14. Challenging the commission?s order, the club said that the commission in Meghalaya did not have jurisdiction to issue such direction on an incident, which had happened outside that state. The commission acted upon a complaint made by Tailin Lyngdoh, a governess, who accused the club and its members of allowing racial profiling of people, which was tantamount to racial discrimination of tribal people, which is a punishable offence. On June 25, staffers of the Delhi Golf Club had asked Lyngdoh, an invited guest, to leave the dining room because her traditional Khasi attire ?jainsem? looked like a ?maid?s uniform?.

The CBSE has been instructed to take up the issue with school managements,? Anand said.The CBSE is the country?s top school board and more than 10,000 institutions are affiliated to it.Most schools teach computers and the internet has become part of the curriculum, enhancing knowledge as well as putting the students at risk of being sexually exploited online. Children in school buses accessing porn on mobile phones remain a grey area.There is no accurate data on the number of Indian children being exploited in pornographic material as many victims do not go to police because of fear and shame. There were 96 reports of children being sexually exploited online in 2015, according to National Crimes Records Bureau data.The government told a three-judge bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra that it will take steps to deal with the ?situation in its entirety?.It said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) shares an Interpol list on online child sexual abuse material with the government, which then orders internet service providers to block these sites.

While New Delhi contends large-scale influx from across the border, Dhaka has denied these migrants are their citizens.There was no such difference though when officials of both nations agreed on Thursday to construct gates along the border to allow ?free and safe passage? for wild elephants.Setting up of the gates was one of the 18 points of action agreed between both countries at the 2nd Indo-Bangladesh dialogue on trans-boundary conservation of elephants held at Shillong.?Trans-border migration of animals is a natural process. But due to erection of border fences, there have been occasions when elephants have broken barriers to continue on their route. The gates will allow them safe passage,? India?s director general of forest Siddhanta Das told HT.Officials have identified 12 points in Meghalaya and one in Assam along the border, which are used by wild elephants to travel to Bangladesh, where the gates will be constructed.It is estimated nearly 20 pachyderms from India move to Bangladesh annually around winter and return later.?We will be tracking these animals and use the services of security and forest personnel on both sides of the border to ensure that the elephants don?t face any problems,? said Das.Construction of the gates, which would require cutting of border fencing between both countries at some points, is expected to be over before the 3rd round of the dialogue on the issue in Dhaka next year.Both countries also agreed to discourage and regulate construction of electric fences to protect crops in the areas which fall in the routes taken by the elephants to prevent deaths due to electrocution.Measures to prevent or bring down incidents of human-elephant conflict while the pachyderms crisscross between both countries, such as setting up warning systems and planting of trees to act as bio-fence, were also discussed.There are nearly 9,000 wild elephants in the northeast region, around 1800 of them in Meghalaya alone, and sometimes they venture to Bangladesh in search of food or mates.Last year, a wild elephant was swept away to Bangladesh by the flooded waters of Brahmaputra from Dhubri in Assam.

Preet Kaur Gill, who won the Edgbaston seat for the Labour party in the June 8 snap general election, was elected to the Home Affairs Select Committee in the UK Parliament. \"We had no Sikh MPs prior to this election. So, Sikhs had no representation, and we had no female Sikh representation. Parliament must reflect the people it serves,? said the 44- year-old, who will join 10 other British MPs on the committee. The House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee was chaired by Keith Vaz, Britains longest-serving Indian-origin MP, until he stepped down from the post last year. Its newly-elected chair is Labour party MP Yvette Cooper, elected unopposed to the post last week. The Committee chooses its own subjects of inquiry and seeks written and oral evidence from a wide range of relevant groups and individuals. At the end of an inquiry, the committee often produces a report setting out its findings and making recommendations to the UK government.

Traffic on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway (NH-8) has been a major challenge for the Gurgaon administration, with  vehicles from multiple points converging on Hero Honda Chowk and resulting in snarls, often stretching to several hours. The flyover project had been proposed to take the load of vehicles on the stretch and facilitate a smooth flow of local and long-distance traffic.With the eight-lane flyover likely to ensure smooth and uninterrupted flow of long-distance traffic, local commuters will find it easy to move from one side of the expressway to the other.

Now a signed and dated copy is about to be auctioned.Snapped by United Press International photographer Arthur Sasse as Einstein departed in the back of car following his 72nd birthday celebrations in 1951, the image shot into the public consciousness after publishers overcame their initial qualms and printed the jovial image.Even the Nobel laureate himself was amused at the photo, requesting cropped copies which he then signed and gave to friends. But the current auctioneers note that the image that is set to go under the hammer on 27 July is unusual in also showing the companions who left the Princeton club with Einstein that night: Frank Aydelotte, director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, where Einstein worked, and Aydelotte?s wife, Marie Jeanette.If previous sales are a guide, the latest lot could scoop a sizeable sum: copies signed by the physicist have recently sold for almost $44,000, with a signed, cropped version of the photo bearing a handwritten German rhyme selling for $125,000.Einstein?s leather jacket sold for Â£110,000 last year, but a photograph may be a safer bet for Einstein aficionados: the jacket was dubbed ?rather pungent? by the auctioneers.', 'In an extreme form of street crime, three men chased a 20-year-old youth for several hundred metres before beating him to death on the main platform of the busy Adarsh Nagar railway station in north Delhi.At least 50 passengers and vendors stood and watched as the three men rained punches and kicks on Rahul?s head, chest and private parts. The three could have easily gotten away after the murder but for a head constable who decided to take on the killers and nab them.While Rahul could never live to tell his story, the killers have claimed in police interrogation that they were chasing Rahul as he had allegedly snatched Rs20,000 from one of their hands. No cash, however, was found on Rahul?s body or pockets after his murder.A resident of Jahangirpuri in north Delhi, Rahul worked as a loader at the wholesale vegetable market in Azadpur.

On Thursday afternoon, he met a trucker friend in the vegetable market.?The trucker was carrying Rs 20,000 with him and Rahul saw that. He requested that the money be lent to him for a few days, but the truck driver refused. Suddenly, Rahul snatched the money and ran,? said an investigator quoting the killers.Road rage to fight over food bill: Why Delhi is on short fuseThe trucker allegedly called on his two friends, who too work as loaders, as they began chasing Rahul. What really led to the chase and the murder is entirely based on the claims of the suspects. In any case, Rahul sprinted from the market with the three men close on his heels. ?He ran for several hundred metres before scaling a wall to land at the premises of the Adarsh Nagar railway station. He must have thought he was safe amid a large gathering of train passengers, but he was not spared,? said an investigator.Rahul found himself surrounded by the men on platform number 1, barely a few metres from the station?s main entrance. ?The men did not have any weapons on them. They thrashed him. Rahul initially tried to fight back, but collapsed after receiving a few blows,? said a railway staffer, who was at the platform at that time.Not a single passenger dared to take on the killers. But one of them managed to alert a policeman who was deployed at the station. He and a home guard chased the killers and caught them from the station premises itself. They have been arrested and identified as Ravi, Lalit and Rajender.Police have said they are awaiting the autopsy report to confirm blow to which body part led to Rahul?s death. The police continue to investigate if Rahul had actually snatched the money or there was some other motive behind the murder.', \"From Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Lil Champs to The Voice, Sabse Bada Kalakaar to Junior Masterchef India and Super Dancer, reality shows featuring children are a common feature on Indian television.Last week, filmmaker Shoojit Sircar, known for films like Piku, Pink and Madras CafÃ©, tweeted that authorities should ban reality television shows for children. The tweet got close to 12,000 likes and was retweeted over 7,000 times, reigniting a long-standing debate. Other voices joined the debate, including filmmaker Amol Gupte, who worked with child artistes in Taare Zameen Par, and protested against the long working hours and exploitative conditions.Humble request to authorities to urgently ban all reality shows involving children.it's actually destroying them emotionally & their purity.? Shoojit Sircar (@ShoojitSircar) July 4, 2017Reality shows are sold as platforms to discover and showcase the latent talent of children. Parents and children from differing socio-economic backgrounds are attracted to the idea of a dream launchpad. In India, the success stories of singers Sunidhi Chauhan and Shreya Ghoshal, who were discovered as child artistes on reality shows, are the benchmarks that every parent with a talented child aspires towards.Sunidhi was 13 when she won India?s first singing reality show on Doordarshan, Meri Aawaz Suno. ?The year was 1996 and it was pure competition,? reminisces Sunidhi. But her opinion of today?s reality shows is decisive: children are ?exposed to so much, so soon?. ?I would never want my children to go through this,? says Sunidhi, who has judged contestants on leading singing shows like Indian Idol and The Voice. ?I don?t think it?s required for any reality show to make children do things that only older people would do. They don?t need to mature ahead of their age,? she says. In the name of showcasing talent, ?cuteness? becomes a saleable factor, blurring the line between precocious and inappropriate. For Shekhar Ravjiani, one half of the music composer duo Vishal-Shekar, and a judge on Indian Idol Junior Season one (2013) and The Voice India Kids (2016), singing show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa back in 1997 was his first break. While he doesn?t advocate an all-out ban, there are concerns.?Some shows encourage children to dress and behave like adults and that to me is jarring,? says Shekhar. ?It takes away their purity, simplicity and most importantly their innocence and makes them aware of things that don?t matter at all.?Behind the scenesReality shows featuring children have been around for a long time, but the pressures involved have changed. When Sunidhi participated in Meri Awaz Suno more than two decades ago, there was no system of vote-and-SMS from the audience. She was judged by legends such as Lata Mangeshkar, Bhupen Hazarika and Manna Dey, and the winners were chosen based on their performances alone. While a reality show was always a full-scale production, on-stage theatrics and appearances were kept to a minimum.?There were no back stories shared with the viewers, it was all about the quality of singing,? says Sunidhi. ?Their singing will tell their stories, if they are good.?Back in the 1990s, popular dance show Boogie Woogie and the singing competition Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, both of which started as contests for adults, were introduced in an all-new avatar targeting children. ?The idea then was to showcase young and obscure talent,? notes a 2008 article in Mint, ?nothing was promised or bequeathed, except the vague idea that once seen, someone, somewhere would maybe sign them on for a minor playback singing role in a movie.?For Shekhar, his reality show stint meant recognition of his talent. ?In an era where being a musician wasn?t considered to be a credible career choice, my talent was given the importance that made my family and others sit up and notice,? he says.The focus has shifted. Children on reality shows are not just ?discovered? or polished, but are groomed to become versatile artistes who can perform onstage and enthral millions. Meghna Prem, a TV programming and content strategist with an experience of over 20 years in the entertainment industry, says, ?Teenage kids are expected to diet to look a certain way, dress a certain way. Because unlike yesteryears, today when you are selecting a reality star, s/he can?t just be a great singer and not be good looking.?When ambition meets pressureAruna Broota, a Delhi-based psychologist has counselled several professional child actors and child atheletes. According to her, the pressures faced by children on reality shows are no different, perhaps worse. Not only are the participants too young to worry about discovering their ambitions, but are often under pressure from fame-thirsty parents trying to live their dreams vicariously.?The child?s ?ambitions? are artificially hyped, because it?s mostly an adult who takes the decision for them,? says Broota. ?S/He might have that S-Factor, or the special ability factor, be it in singing, dancing or acting. But when one starts expecting a lot from one?s s-factor in terms of competition, it distorts the personality development of the child.? At an age when all they should be worried about is playing, studying and having fun, children are entangled in a web of competition and stress.This is not the first time that a discussion on the need to regulate child participation in reality shows has come up. In 2011, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) drew up new guidelines to prevent exploitation of children participating in TV shows and advertisements.Over five years have elapsed since the report was released, yet the realities on the ground paint a different, disturbing picture. Under the NCPCR guidelines, no child should be made to deliver lines or enact scenes that are inappropriate for his or her age. Yet, children dancing on raunchy numbers or belting out romantic songs is mined for applause and laughs. A web of competition and stressReality television immediately catapults children to popularity. Suddenly every parent wants his/her child to become like them. Neighbours are extra doting. They are now their teachers? favourite student, no longer tied to the compulsions of attendance in school. Cameras click wherever they go. They get to rub shoulders with their idols from the industry. They are famous, and everyone knows them. But what happens once the show ends?Salman Khan and Sohail Khan during the promotion of film Tubelight on the sets of Zee TV`s musical reality Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Li`l Champs.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(IANS)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t?In reality shows, kids are complimented so much that they get used to it,? says Chauhan. ?When a participant is told s/he sang better than the original, the kid thinks s/he has arrived. And when they face any criticism or are eliminated, their ego and confidence come crashing down. Self-doubt sets in. And I think it?s too early for them to feel any of these emotions.?Children find it difficult to cope with the lull once their 15 minutes of fame are over. ?Either they get into depression, or develop different kinds of behaviour pathologies,? says Broota. ?Just to grab attention and have that sense of power, some take to lying and self-harm. Alienation in schools from their peers is yet another outcome of this limelight.?Meghna recounts instances when participants of reality shows talked to her about how they feel their equations with friends changed. ?She was my best friend, but now she isn?t talking to me anymore?, she remembers one of the participants confiding. The race for TRP means high drama on stage. Cameras zoom into tight close ups of parents crying when their kids are eliminated. What message does that send out to the child? ?You have let us down,? says Broota. A child, who would otherwise have been indifferent and taken the judges? decision with a smile, is filled with guilt because s/he can see the disappointment on his parents? face.Show runners ensure that TRPs are not valued over children?s mental and emotional well-being ? running a reality show for kids is after all, no child?s play. But Shekhar believes that parents? shoulder the responsibility of knowing what they are putting their child through. ?They should judge the environment where they are sending their kids and ensure that their child is able to withstand the long working hours that these shoots sometimes entail,? he says.\", 'The world?s eight richest billionaires control the same wealth between them as the poorest half of the globe?s population, according to a charity warning of an ever-increasing and dangerous concentration of wealth.In a report published to coincide with the start of the week-long World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was ?beyond grotesque? that a handful of rich men headed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth $426bn (Â£350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people.The development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trump?s victory in the US presidential election.Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives.The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation.Oxfam said the world?s poorest 50% owned the same in assets as the $426bn owned by a group headed by Gates, Amancio Ortega, the founder of the Spanish fashion chain Zara, and Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway.The others are Carlos Slim HelÃº: the Mexican telecoms tycoon and owner of conglomerate Grupo Carso; Jeff Bezos: the founder of Amazon; Mark Zuckerberg: the founder of Facebook; Larry Ellison, chief executive of US tech firm Oracle; and Michael Bloomberg; a former mayor of New York and founder and owner of the Bloomberg news and financial information service.Last year, Oxfam said the world?s 62 richest billionaires were as wealthy as half the world?s population. However, the number has dropped to eight in 2017 because new information shows that poverty in China and India is worse than previously thought, making the bottom 50% even worse off and widening the gap between rich and poor.With members of the forum due to arrive on Monday in Switzerland, where guests will range from the Chinese president Xi Jinping, to pop star Shakira, the WEF released its own inclusive growth and development report in which it said median income had fallen by an average of 2.4% between 2008 and 2013 across 26 advanced nations.Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland and Denmark filled the top five places in the WEF?s inclusive development index, with Britain 21st and the US 23rd. The body that organises the Davos event said rising inequality was not an ?iron law of capitalism?, but a matter of making the right policy choices.The WEF report found that 51% of the 103 countries for which data was available saw their inclusive development index scores decline over the past five years, ?attesting to the legitimacy of public concern and the challenge facing policymakers regarding the difficulty of translating economic growth into broad social progress?.Basing its research on the Forbes rich list and data provided by investment bank Credit Suisse, Oxfam said the vast majority of people in the bottom half of the world?s population were facing a daily struggle to survive, with 70% of them living in low-income countries. It was four years since the WEF had first identified inequality as a threat to social stability, but that the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen, Oxfam added.?From Brexit to the success of Donald Trump?s presidential campaign, a worrying rise in racism and the widespread disillusionment with mainstream politics, there are increasing signs that more and more people in rich countries are no longer willing to tolerate the status quo,? the report said.The charity said new information had shown that poor people in China and India owned even fewer assets than previously thought, making the wealth gap more pronounced than it thought a year ago, when it announced that 62 billionaires owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the global population.Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: ?This year?s snapshot of inequality is clearer, more accurate and more shocking than ever before. It is beyond grotesque that a group of men who could easily fit in a single golf buggy own more than the poorest half of humanity. ?While one in nine people on the planet will go to bed hungry tonight, a small handful of billionaires have so much wealth they would need several lifetimes to spend it. The fact that a super-rich elite are able to prosper at the expense of the rest of us at home and overseas shows how warped our economy has become.?Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said: ?Once again Oxfam have come out with a report that demonises capitalism, conveniently skimming over the fact that free markets have helped over 100 million people rise out of poverty in the last year alone.?The Oxfam report added that since 2015 the richest 1% has owned more wealth than the rest of the planet. It said that over the next 20 years, 500 people will hand over $2.1tn to their heirs ? a sum larger than the annual GDP of India, a country with 1.3 billion people. Between 1988 and 2011 the incomes of the poorest 10% increased by just $65, while the incomes of the richest 1% grew by $11,800 ? 182 times as much.Oxfam called for fundamental change to ensure that economies worked for everyone, not just ?a privileged few?. ', 'Tamil Nadu Milk and Dairy Products Developments Minister Rajendra Balaji once again stirred a controversy by alleging that the products of private milk producers are adulterated.

Usually the meal involves an antipasto ? bruschetta or platters of prosciutto are fairly typical ? and then a pasta dish, followed by a meat dish and then vegetables.Unlike the disciplined French children portrayed by Pamela Druckerman in her book Bringing up BÃ©bÃ© who sit quietly through restaurant meals as their parents engage in adult conversation, Italian families are stereotypically more rowdy, with loud behaviour often indulged by parents who see it as as a normal childhood phenomenon.  Ferrari ? who does not have children ? was at pains to point out that his intention was not to be too judgmental, telling Corriere della Sera: ?I imagine how difficult parenting is today.?Nevertheless, he thought something had to be done to rein-in children splashing water in the restaurant?s bathrooms and bothering other customers by running around tables.He recalled some parents telling him his restaurant was essentially public, and that they could do what they want. But he added: ?I?m responsible for what happens in it.?The party who earned the coveted discount were delighted by the news and left a ?30 (Â£25) tip, Ferrari said.

But it all changed for Akshay Kumar on Friday afternoon (April 7) when he won the national award for Best Actor for Rustom. Known to be a bankable actor, Akshay has become a favourite with fans and directors in the last few years. And his performance in 2016 film Rustom has won him his first national award.

Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said, \"One may disagree with Nathuram Godse and his co-accused but we cannot refuse disclosure or circulation of his opinion. \"At the same time, neither Nathuram Godse nor the holder of his theme or opinion can go to the extent of killing a person whose philosophy he cannot agree with,\" he said in his order. Godse, a right-wing activist, had assassinated the Mahatma on January 30, 1948. Petitioner Ashutosh Bansal had demanded the charge sheet and Godses statement, among other details, from Delhi Police which forwarded the application to the National Archives of India (NAI), saying the records have been handed over to it. The National Archives asked Bansal to inspect the records and cull out the information. After failure to get the information, Bansal approached the Central Information Commissioner (CIC). Acharyulu directed the Central Public Information Commissioner (CPIO-NAI) not to charge Rs three per page for photocopying because the Right to Information Act overrides any such provision of the Public Records Act by virtue of Section 22 of the RTI Act. Although neither Delhi Police nor the National Archives cited any objection on the disclosure of the information, Acharyulu said that the information sought does not attract any of the exemption clauses. He said since the information is more than 20-years-old, it cannot be withheld unless it attracts section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act which prohibits disclosure of information that prejudicially affects security of the State or relations with foreign countries. Acharyulu said in the present case, even section 8(1)(a) does not apply as the argument that disclosure of Godses statement could lead to enmity between Hindu and Muslim communities would not apply.

The debate on privacy as a fundamental right is a part of the larger debate on Aadhaar and if the scheme violates one\\'s right to privacy.The Centre has earlier said that petitions challenging the validity of Aadhaar over violation of privacy cannot be entertained under Article 21. ATTORNEY GENERAL MOUNTS DEFENCEArguing for the Centre, AG Venugopal said that framers of the Constitution intentionally omitted mention of privacy as a fundamental right. There are several aspects to Right to Life such as right to food, shelter and employment but everything does not enjoy the status of a fundamental right, said K K Venugopal in the Supreme Court today. The Attorney General said that there is no absolute Right to Life and deprivation of the right in certain instances is in-built in the Constitution. He said that while life and liberty are qualified rights under the Constitution but their every aspect is not a fundamental right and it cannot be elevated to that status. Petitioners want privacy on a whole to be declared as a fundamental right but it will have grave consequences, argued Attorney General Venugopal. He said that a World Bank report has identified Aadhaar as a great scheme for developing countries.THREE STATES SUPPORT PETITIONERSKapil Sibal, appearing for the states Karnataka, West Bengal and Puducherry, told the nine-judge bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khekar that the states support the petitioners on the argument that privacy is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Kapil Sibal said that while privacy is not mentioned in the Constitution of America and Australia but it is a fundamental right. WHAT HAVE THE PETITIONED SAIDSenior counsel Gopal Subramanium told the Supreme Court last Wednesday that the Preamble to the Constitution intrinsically guarantees the right. He said that liberty, which is fundamental to a democracy, cannot exist without privacy.Senior counsel Arvind Datar argued that right to privacy flows from Article 14 (Right to Equality), Article 19 (Freedom of Expression) and Article 21 (Right to Life). Arguing for privacy as a fundamental right, Dattar said that the court must not strictly lay the right to privacy under a single article. Former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee , appearing in support of privacy right, said that even if the Constitution did not \"explicitly\" provide this right, it could be deduced as had been done in the case of freedom of press.WHAT HAS THE COURT SAID SO FARWhile hearing the petitioners, the Supreme Court observed that right to privacy cannot be absolute and the state may have powers to put reasonable curbs. The nine-judge Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice J S Khekar, comprises Justices J Chelameswar, S A Bobde, R K Agrawal, Rohinton Fali Nariman, Abhay Manohar Sapre, D Y Chandrachud, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer. \"We live in an age of big data and the state is entitled to regulate the data whether it is for the purpose of regulating crime, taxation or other activities... Right to privacy cannot be so absolute that it prevents the state from legislating or regulating it,\" the Constitution bench said.The Supreme Court also observed that ignorance of citizens on how personal data furnished by them was being used could not be the basis for not testing the validity of a law, in this case the Aadhaar Act.(With inputs from Anusha Soni and agencies) ALSO READ:Aadhaar vs WhatsApp: How privacy changes meaning for government in different cases ', 'Two significant developments have taken place with regard to the question of building Ram temple at Ayodhya since Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.

Luckily, no damage to life or property was reported from Uttarakhand or other parts of north India rattled by the quake epicentered 31km below the earth surface in Pipalkoti near Rudraprayag.Uttarakhand and the northern Himalayan region have witnessed several high and medium intensity tremors in the recent past. Nepal was devastated by a magnitude 7.9 quake on April 25, 2015. However, experts have warned of a catastrophic earthquake in north India in near future. Several reports based on study of movement of tectonic plates have pointed out that a catastrophic earthquake could hit Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of north India in years to come.Scientists of Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) said that the big one could come sooner than expected. Dr Sushil Kumar, senior scientist at WIHG,Â\\xa0 explained the Indian Plate is moving towards the Eurasian Plate at the speed of 45 mm/year causing immense pressure under the earth surface in the region, a report in Jagran  said.The Himalayan region has had four major earthquakes in the past 150 years. According to geologists, the regions between Kangra and Nepal-Bihar did not experience any earthquake for a long time till the April 25, 2015 earthquake. The region was the \"maximum probable zone\" for an earthquake. The Himalayas had experienced three great quakes during the past century -Â\\xa0 Nepal-Bihar (1934), upper Assam (in 1950) and Kangra, Himachal Pradesh (1905).HOW THE HIMALAYAN RANGE WAS CREATEDThe earth\\'s landmasses ride like gigantic rafts on \"plates\", or sections of the earth\\'s outermost layer, the crust. These plates frequently slip and slide, causing earthquakes. We don\\'t feel the small ones. The big ones, literally, shake us up.The Himalayas and north India are on particularly shaky ground. Sometime in the geological past, before humans, India broke off from an ancient supercontinent called Gondwana, a name still used for what is now Chhattisgarh.The Indian plate skewed north, displaced an ancient sea, travelled more than 2,000 km - the fastest a plate has ever moved - and slammed into the Eurasian plate, creating the Himalayas.About 60 per cent of India is vulnerable to earthquakes caused by the great, northward grind of the Indian subcontinental landmass.according to geologists, the 1950 Assam earthquake may have geologically set the stage for a really big one in the Himalayas. Now that 65 years have passed, it may be time for a big one.(With inputs from IANS)', 'A 13-year-old girl from south Delhi, who allegedly eloped with her neighbour two months ago, returned last week and was found to be three months pregnant.

And the electricity you?ve created ? together ? in the cavernous place of worship, could power a small town.I have experienced this sensation on four occasions, before four Christopher Nolan films, and each of those experiences were, and remain to this day, some of the most special I?ve had inside a movie theatre.And yesterday, it happened again.Dunkirk, a film about men, created by men, is a force of nature ? an elemental beast of a movie about finding the meaning of life surrounded by the meaninglessness of war. It is an existential masterpiece set across three parallel plots destined to collide, which in turn are set on three planes of existence ? earth, air, and water. To us, these elements symbolise life, but in Dunkirk, they might as well be harbingers of death, having suspended our characters in their purgatory as they await judgment.On the land, in the seaside French town of Dunkirk, 400,000 soldiers have been pushed by ?the enemy? ? curiously, not once are the Nazis mentioned ? towards the sea. They wait, bombarded from behind, and up above, for deliverance. Before them lies a seemingly endless expanse of blue ? and home, England, is practically within sight, across the choppy waters of the Channel. They go from boat to boat ? some even conning their way onto the rickety barges ? desperate to get off the cursed beach, as torpedoes attack them from below, and missiles rain like hellfire from the sky.They?re in need of a miracle.But help is on its way. Tom Hardy protects them from above, acting, like he did in The Dark Knight Rises, through a mask, and only with his eyes. And his eyes are all he needs to convey the (sometimes scarily suicidal) determination to save his countrymen, as he picks off one Luftwaffe fighter after another ? even as his wingmen perish, and his fuel gauge begs him to stop.Below him, on the water, a civilian Mark Rylance has commandeered a boat, one of the many deployed by the Navy in an effort to aid the evacuation process. With his teenage son, and his son?s eager friend in tow ? but without a firm plan ? he sails into war.And with the precision of a watchmaker ? time is an oft-repeated motif in the film ? Nolan, a master working at the peak of his powers, puts the pieces of this jigsaw together with some of his most effortless editing since Inception. And like Inception, as layer after layer of Dunkirk?s nesting doll structure is uncovered, and when the three stories finally converge after almost two hours of merciless tension, the emotional release is pure ecstasy.Often, in order to build this tension, the experimental work of genius that it is, Dunkirk spends long stretches in silence. DP Hoyte van Hoytema?s IMAX camera, taking a break from soaring across the skies, wrestling for space among thousands of men, and gazing placidly at the sheer beauty of it all, brings the actors? faces inches from its own. And these fine performers ? mostly young stars (Harry Styles included) ? convey wordlessly the torment raging in their characters? minds.But because of these periods of silence, and because of Nolan?s refusal to rely on words (or, for that matter, a traditional structure) to tell his story, Hans Zimmer?s terrific score becomes crucial, and slowly, emerges as a character in its own right. Like the film, it is unrelentingly intense, stretched to breaking point as it conjures tension seemingly from nothing.And such is Nolan?s power at commanding the attention of his audience, that you find yourself overlooking basic flaws. There isn?t a single character in this film that is properly fleshed out, and it fails miserably at the Bechdel Test. But never have these glaring missteps mattered less.Do you remember what Bruce Wayne said at the end of The Dark Knight Rises? Moments before flying into certain death, he looked at Commissioner Gordon, and growled, ?A hero can be anyone.?And this is the sentiment that Nolan has carried into Dunkirk. These characters aren?t meant to have elaborate backstories or complicated motivations. They?re meant to represent an ideal. They?re meant to embody our bravery and our empathy and our kindness.A hero can be anyone, from a middle-aged sailor who just wants to teach his son to do the right thing, to a decorated commander who refuses to leave until every last man who serves under him ? or even if he doesn?t ? has been saved.Dunkirk is one of the greatest war movies ever made ? it?s certainly the tightest, most unwaveringly propulsive film of Christopher Nolan?s career. But it?s also as meditative as The Thin Red Line, as brutal as Saving Private Ryan, and sometimes, even as surreal as Apocalypse Now.It deserves to be seen big and loud.Watch the Dunkirk trailer hereFollow @htshowbiz for moreThe author tweets @RohanNaahar', 'Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday invoked Hindu gods and gurus featuring in the original manuscript of Indian Constitution to suggest the extent of \\'minority appeasement\\' and \\'pseudo secularism\\' prevalent in the country. Addressing a seminar at the India International Centre where former chief justices, ex-diplomats, constitutional experts and lawyers were part of the panel, he said original manuscript of the Indian constitution had pictures of several Hindu gods and idols like Ram, Krishna, Arjun Nataraja, Vivekananda and Guru Gobind Singh. He said if the constitution was drafted today, one wondered the pictures would have been allowed on its pages. \"Where has this country gone? We will have to reflect. I am only trying to provoke a debate\", he said.\"Today is the birthday of Swami Vivekananda. I would request all of them sitting here to have a look at the original constitution.

And except for seven depots under five zonal railways, linens had not been sanitised in the other selected depots, the CAG has said.During 2015-2016, in respect of 12 coaching depots of eight zonal railways, blankets had been washed after an interval of 6-26 months, the report stated.These depots included Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (Mumbai), Sealdah (Kolkata), Gwalior, Guwahati, Dibrugarh, Lucknow, Secunderabad, and Hatia and Tatanagar (in Jharkhand).The report also said there were general stores depots which stored fresh linens along with those that were to be discarded. At the Basin Bridge depot in Chennai, pillow covers were being stitched from the used bedsheets to tide over shortages.In a few cases, in the Northern Railway, used pillow covers were provided to the passengers, the report said.The audit report said there was a need for the railways to increase the pace of setting up of mechanised laundries and prescribe norms for quality standards for washed linen.?A mechanism may be put in place to ensure strict compliance to norms of cleaning blankets and pillows as per required periodicity,? it said.The CAG also said at many storage depots, fresh linen was stored haphazardly and was exposed to dirt and contamination.?Proper storage space may be provided for storage of linen in store depots, so that linen can be issued in an organised manner,? it recommended.It has also advocated providing ?adequate storage space? for linen in coaching depots.In Western Railway, new linen was stored in a manner that they were exposed to dirt in storage depots in Mahalakshmi and Sabarmati. At the store in Kharagpur, face towels were kept in a room with broken windows susceptible to damage due to seepage of rainwater.In some zonal railways, new stock remained unutilised almost all their life span.In North Eastern Railway, the audit said, the stock at the depots had already completed two-to-seven months life from the date of manufacture before it was received at the Gorakhpur depot.In the South Eastern Railway, bedsheets (life cycle of 12 months) and pillow covers (life cycle of nine months) remained unutilised for seven months and similarly face towels (life cycle of nine months) remained unutilised for five months at the depots.?This indicated that lot received first were not issued first,? the audit said.In case of pillows too, instructions were not followed, it said.?Blankets and pillows were not dry cleaned and/or sanitised for long periods before supply to the passengers,? the audit said.The audit report also recommended that railways seek regular feedback from passengers to effectively improve passenger satisfaction in respect of quality of linen. ', 'Expressway, speed and a rush of adrenaline - the result is always fatal and 28-year-old Asad Malik became the latest victim of speed junkies on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.On Saturday afternoon, Malik\\'s Eeco car was smashed by a Lamborghini that swerved to avoid a speeding Swift Dzire, resulting in his death. Strangely, the same 23-km-long expressway allegedly witnessed an illegal horse race too recently. The act was caught on camera and the video clip went viral on social media websites.The series of incidents not just raise questions on the safety feature of the expressway but also on the role of Noida police which is well-equipped to monitor such stretches. Even after 24 hours of the incident, Noida police have no clue about the identity of the Lamborghini driver involved in the accident. Similarly, the police were caught unaware on the horse-racing incident and are now scanning CCTV footages.INVESTIGATION IN THE CAR ACCIDENTThe investigation in the car accident is also based on the CCTV footage. The police have caught the driver of Swift Dzire and identified him as Mohsin Khan. \"All the cars involved in the accident were at a very high speed. CCTV footages show that speeding Swift Dzire was behind the Lamborghini car and tried to overtake it. The driver of Swift lost control and ventured into the lane of Lamborghini, forcing the driver of the sports car to swerve and avoid a collision. However, he smashed an Eeco, leading to Malik\\'s death,\" said a senior police officer.Malik was a resident of Joshi Colony and was going to Greater Noida for work. \"He was brought to hospital, but had no pulse and was declared brought dead. He sustained severe head injuries and was bleeding heavily,\" said KK Tripathi, a doctor at Jaypee Hospital.Trying to conceal their failure in identifying the Lamborghini driver, Noida police claims Mohsin is the main accused as he lost control. But Mohsin blames the Lamborghini driver for the accident. \"The Ecco was racing with the Lamborghini and the accident took place between the two. I have no role in the accident as my car didn\\'t even touch any car involved in the mishap. In fact, to avoid the accident, I had to collide my car with the divider. I stopped at the spot to cooperate in the investigation but police arrested me. I could have fled like the Lamborghini driver,\" Mohsin said.NO SUCCESS IN KEEPING A CHECK ON SPEED JUNKIESThe speed limit for heavy vehicles on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway is 60 kmph, and for light motor vehicles, it is 100kmph. There are 132 high definition cameras, installed along the expressway, which work under the highway traffic management system (HTMS) and is designed to capture only images of vehicles moving at more than 100kmph. But Noida police have not got much success in keeping a check on speed junkies.On the other hand, a recent video of horse racing on the expressway has put Noida police on the backfoot over successful usage of the high tech system. A viral video shot by an anonymous user has gone viral on social media, which captures around half a dozen jockeys racing on the highway alongside speeding cars.Noida police confirmed the video was shot at the expressway but are unaware when the incident took place. \"It is a serious matter and we are scanning cameras installed on the highway to check when the incident took place. We are trying to identify the horse riders,\" said a senior officer.But the entire incident also punches holes in patrolling along the expressway considered unsafe by users as many incidents of carjacking and robbery have taken place here. For many years Noida expressway has remained a favorite stretch for motorists as it offers non-stop drive till Greater Noida and further connects till Agra via Yamuna expressway. It is easy to spot 1000cc bikes and high-end sports cars cruising on this stretch and often \\'illegally\\' used by motorists to race for money.Also Read:Bangladesh: 17 people killed in road accident in Rangpur', 'The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, came face to face with his namesake as he met the baby of Syrian refugees who was named in his honour.The meeting took place at the Calgary Stampede on Saturday, where two-month-old Justin Trudeau Adam Bilan slept happily as the prime minister briefly held him.The boy?s parents, Muhammad and Afraa Bilan, named him as a gesture of thanks to the country that offered them sanctuary.The family came to Canada from Damascus in February last year, after escaping the Syria?s war.

The diminutive nun of Albanian descent went around the streets of Kolkata since 1948 to be with the poor and the destitutes wearing a white sari with three blue borders, the outer border being wider than the two inner ones. \"The blue-designed border on the sari worn by nuns of the Missionaries of Charity was recognised as Intellectual Property for the organisation on September four, 2016, the day the Mother was canonised,\" Sarkar told PTI here. \"The Missionaries of Charity does not believe in publicity and as such it was not publicised, but since we are witnessing unscrupulous and unfair usage of the design across the globe, we are now trying to spread awareness among people about the trademark,\" Sarkar said. \"The blue border pattern is a distinctive symbolic identity of the Missionaries of Charity under the concept of colour trade mark protection,\" he said. Applications were filed before the Trade Marks Registry on December 12, 2013 and after \"a stringent test of legal proceedings\" for nearly three years, the registrations were granted. In order to mark the sainthood of Mother Teresa, the Government of India granted the trade mark registration on the same day on September four, 2016, despite it being a Sunday, Sarkar said. The exclusive right of use of the said blue pattern on white saris adopted by the Missionaries of Charity is unique and is the first time ever that a uniform has been protected under the Intellectual Property rights, the attorney said. Born in 1910 at Skopje in Macedonia in a Catholic family and baptised as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, she came to India in 1929 as Sister Mary Teresa and went to Darjeeling for her novitiate period. She later came to Kolkata and was assigned as a teacher at Saint Marys High School for Girls before she was given consent by her convent in 1948 to work for the poor.

If by saying Jai Shri Ram I can do some good for the Muslims, why is there such a hue and cry,? Ahmad, who has been given charge of minority welfare and sugarcane industries, told mediapersons.He would not be cowed down by such threats, he said.The minister later apologised for his statement, while talking to a TV channel.?The CM told me if anybody felt hurt by my statement, I should apologise.

Bihar BJP spokesman Azfar Shamshi said.Ahmad had taken forward the Indian tradition while the fatwa was against it. ?The days are gone when Muslims were waylaid on sentimental issues. Now, they want solutions to their core issues,? he said.Maryada Purushottam Ram was known as Imam-e-Hind (an ideal person), he said, adding Indonesia, which has the world?s highest number of Muslims, had named its national carrier named Garuda while several building were named Ramayan.In Hindu mythology, Garuda is the mount of Lord Vishnu. Ram is an incarnation of Vishnu.?It is the spirit of Ram that is important and there is no need to fan sentiments,?

', 'Nagaland chief minister Shurhozelie Liezietsu and nine ruling Naga People?s Front (NPF) legislators skipped Wednesday?s floor test, forcing assembly speaker Imtiwapang Aier to adjourn the special session of the House.It could not be immediately confirmed if the speaker sent a report in this regard to state governor PB Acharya. Acharya had summoned the special session of the assembly at 9:30am after the Nagaland bench of the Gauhati high court on Tuesday dismissed Shurhozelie?s petition challenging the floor test that was earlier to be held by July 15. An MLA in Shurhozelie?s camp, declining to be quoted, said the chief minister and his loyalists could not attend the special assembly session because they had to attend a funeral service in state capital Kohima?s Bayavu Hill. Dissidence by 34 (later 37) out of 47 NPF legislators led by former chief minister TR Zeliang triggered the latest political crisis in Nagaland. Zeliang and his team checked into a resort in Assam?s Kaziranga on Saturday 8 before they had to be evacuated because of flood in July 14. That very day, Shurhozelile went to court challenging Acharya?s July 9 call to prove his majority on the floor of the house on or before July 15. The court gave a temporary breather to Shurhozelie before the floor test could be held last Saturday. NPF spokesperson Achumbemo Kikon, a member of Shurhozelie?s legal team, indicated the chief minister would not give up easily without a fight. ?We are exploring many options before us,? he told reporters in Kohima. The Zeliang camp, whose MLAs had unusually been travelling by bus to keep the flock together, did not react. Zeliang , who claims the support of 43 MLAs including seven independents, had accused Shurhozelie of ?undemocratic style of functioning? and ?nepotism?. It was primarily a reference to the chief minister appointing his son Khriehu Liezietsu as his advisor with cabinet minister status on June 27. Khriehu declined the ?offer? offer 13 days later, but by then the damage ? rebellion against his father ? was already done. His appointment was seen as payback for resigning from the Northern Angami-I seat for letting his father contest to continue as chief minister.

On Tuesday night, after the governor sought a floor test, the Shurhozelie camp of NPF issued a whip to all its 47 MLAs for Wednesday?s floor test. The party warned that failure to comply would invite ?consequences? as provided under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution. The Shurhozelie camp of NPF also decided to sever its 40-year-old ties with the BJP and approach the President of India for recalling the governor ?so that the sanctity of the Raj Bhawan is maintained in future?.

Unless water temperatures quickly return to normal, the coral eventually dies from lack of nutrition.The plight of the reef, located in Japan?s southernmost reaches, has become ?extremely serious? in recent years, according to the ministry, whose survey of 35 locations in the lagoon last November and December found that 70.1% percent of the coral had died.The dead coral has now turned dark brown and is now covered with algae, the Yomiuri Shimbun said.The newspaper said the average sea surface temperature between last June and August in the southern part of the Okinawa island chain was 30.1 degrees centigrade ? or one to two degrees warmer than usual ? and the highest average temperature since records began in 1982, according to the Japan meteorological agency.The ministry report follows warnings by the Coral Reef Watch programme at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that global coral bleaching could become the ?new normal? due to warming oceans.Experts said that bleaching had spread to about 90% of the Sekisei reef, a popular diving spot that covers 400sq km.A similar survey conducted in September and October last year found that just over 56% of the reef had died, indicating that bleaching has spread rapidly in recent months.', 'Senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue Indresh Kumar on Saturday said that Muslims in India have understood that even Allah doesn\\'t want an \\'impure\\' mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya.Speaking to India Today, the veteran RSS functionary and convener of its minority cell - Muslim Rashtriya Manch said, \"Muslims have realised that since Allah himself has not allowed the mosque to come up there, it\\'s unlikely that it will ever come up.\"Questioning the legitimacy of the Babri Masjid, Kumar said that the 15th century structure was named after an individual (Babur) and so it could never be used by Muslims as they only worshiped one God.\"The land is disputed and it was claimed after destroying a Ram temple that existed there, thus Allah never accepted the structure and even namaz was never conducted at the place. Today, Muslims have realized that it was an illegal structure,\" he explained.Going back in time, the veteran RSS ideologue blamed the dispute on a mistake by Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in the subcontinent. TRY BABUR IN COURT \"The Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was destroyed by Babur 400 years ago. Had he not indulged in that act to build such an impure mosque, there would not have been such a predicament today. I would like to appeal to the courts of the land that if someone needs to be tried it should be Babur and his army general Mir Baqi,\" he added.At a time when the RSS backed Muslim Rashtriya Manch is backing the call for a Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, Kumar said that many in the community have stated that they don\\'t want an \\'illegal\\' mosque, especially one that was built on a disputed land.\"They (Muslims) have realised that Ram and Khuda are all the same, they are one supreme power. The only difference being that one is abstract and the other takes the form of Lord Ram,\" he added.According to Kumar, the minority community in India now realises that those who are trying to encroach the land forcefully were neither following the principles of Quran nor the Prophet, but were only interested in continuing the stalemate.\"They believe that Ram is like their Nabi or Paigambar and most definitely that of their ancestors, thus they want a Ram Temple in Ayodhya to end the dispute forever.

It never sustained,\" he told PTI. \"But I think even if there is a union, I dont think it will impact the industry much because IT industry is one of the best paymasters in the country and second, the people find opportunities outside\", he said. The employees unions work in industries where work ethic is bad and where employees are treated shabbily. Following reports of layoffs and fears about further retrenchment in the slow-down hit IT industry, there had been some talk in recent times about forming a union. \"IT industry is not bad, IT industry people are well taken care of, well-paid, and they find opportunities. Even one of the bad years, this year, where growth rate has come down, the attrition is still double digit. \"So, I dont find a need for union in this industry. Even if there is a union, I dont think it will impact the industry much because people are well taken care of in this industry,\" said the former Board member of Infosys. Balakrishnan said the reports about widespread job losses in IT industry are exaggerated. \"If you look at all the leading companies, none of them are talking about huge job losses; they are all talking about the regular performance-based attrition, that is normal in the industry. So, to some extent the scare of job losses is exaggerated,\" he said. He said IT is not a traditional industry. \"Its a global industry where you get global opportunities to work. This industry is different, its not like traditional industry. I dont know whether formal union kind of structure will succeed.\" On if boom times are over for the Indian IT industry, Balakrishnan said: \"Thats what we had been told when 2000 dotcom happened...Y2K came up...2008 financial crisis. Same concerns were expressed then.\" ', \"2016 was an important year for regional cinema. South film industry in particular won 18 National Awards earlier this year.

That makes her ? acclaimed actor, glamorous star, box office queen of her heydays, and Padma Shri award winner ? the perfect person to say what it means to be a woman in this high-pressure industry.  Since being a star is still a lot about one?s appearance, Sridevi says that it?s not an easy task for female actors to consistently maintain standards of perfection. They?re always under pressure to look good, even when they?re not on camera, she says. That pressure has only been increased by the age of social media.?If the actor is being herself, tired , with just a bun on and posts a picture on social media, then the comments will come. So many comments such as ?what is she looking like?, ?what chappal is she wearing?. Then as an actor you feel ,why  give a chance to anyone to do that. You better look your best, even if you are going through hell inside,? says Sridevi, whose performance in her recently released film Mom has garnered appreciation.As for herself, Sridevi says that she managed to steer her career while keeping the pressures at bay. She enjoyed being a leading lady ? ?I got to wear different clothes, I got to do the best roles.? And she didn?t let box office numbers kill her sleep. ?If the picture does well, I?m surprised and happy; and if it doesn?t do well, then it?s part of your profession.

The BJP will look to continue its winning momentum, having resoundingly won Uttar Pradesh in the recent Assembly elections as well as a number of civic bodies in Maharashtra and Odisha. For Congress, the MCD election could be a chance to save face after embarrassing defeats across the country. The party's most recent failure was in the civic polls of Latur, the Maharashtra stronghold that was in the Grand Old Party's control ever since independence.

It was an opportunity for women to discover essential oils. A ?health and wellness group? at the electric car company invited female staff members to an 8 March ?lunch ?n learn? about oils and how they can help improve people?s ?health and happiness?, according to emails seen by the Guardian, which reveal that the proposed event was quickly met with vocal criticism. It was particularly offensive to some given that a week earlier, AJ Vandermeyden, a female engineer, had publicly accused Elon Musk?s company of sexual harassment and discrimination.Tesla postponed the oils session. The company organized a town hall meeting on diversity for that day, which included six male executives and one woman, according to multiple attendees. At the crowded meeting at the Fremont factory, women took the microphone one-by-one and shared stories of sexual harassment, mistreatment by male managers, unfair promotion decisions and more, sources said.Vandermeyden, who attended the meeting, thought the outpouring of comments validated her own story. But soon after, Tesla fired her, accusing her of pursuing a ?miscarriage of justice? by filing a lawsuit that alleged ?pervasive harassment? and pay discrimination. Testimony from the town hall ? along with internal emails from Musk, and Vandermeyden?s first interview since her termination ? paint a picture of a company that has struggled to respond to mounting complaints about gender discrimination and has aggressively attempted to discredit a woman who publicly criticized it .?They just want to absolutely crush anyone who speaks up,? said Vandermeyden, 33, seated inside her attorney?s San Francisco office on a recent afternoon. ?I spoke up, and I was made a sacrificial lamb for it. It?s a scary precedent.?Vandermeyden detailed the painful experience of losing a job she loved while facing harsh personal attacks by Tesla in the media. She has come forward at a time when the tech industry is grappling with high profile sexual misconduct scandals at Uber, a prominent venture capital firm and a popular startup incubator.Tesla, known internationally for its battery-powered vehicles and self-driving car technology, has strongly rejected Vandermeyden?s claims, saying she was terminated for ?falsely attacking our company in the press?. But the flurry of criticisms that emerged at the town hall suggests that her complaints are not unique.Musk was not at the meeting, which was attended by roughly 70-100 people, and featured comments from more than 20 women, according to Vandermeyden and another attendee. One woman described parts of the factory as a ?predator zone? for harassment. When the moderator asked women in the room if they had ever been catcalled, a significant number of women raised their hands, according to Vandermeyden.Other women allegedly talked about feeling unsafe around male managers and facing sexist remarks from superiors. Women talked about being dismissed and talked over in meetings with no other female employees, and asked questions about diversity in hiring and the lack of women in leadership positions.Some of the executives seemed genuinely concerned and taken aback by the women?s comments. One male leader said it was unacceptable, noting that he had daughters, said Vandermeyden.One female manager, who was present but no longer works for Tesla, told the Guardian she was offended by that comment: ?It?s insulting. You shouldn?t have to have daughters to know this.? She said executives? responses to questions about diversity were generic and filled with corporate jargon.Tesla said in an email that a Women in Tesla group hosted the event and that ?executives attended because they wanted to hear directly from employees about their experiences and learn about how to improve the workplace?. The company disputed the Guardian?s characterization of the meeting, saying: ?Employees stood up to ask the executives questions, share their experiences at Tesla ? both positive and negative ? while others spoke of things that they believed Tesla was doing right and some came with suggestions. In some instances, employees were only looking for better collaboration with their HR business partners in general and had nothing to do with any allegations of harassment.?The company statement said that when an employee referenced an area of the factory as a ?predator zone?, it ?surprised many in the room who had never heard of this term?. Immediately after the meeting, Tesla said it sent a factory-wide message to supervisors about its ?strict policy against any kind of harassment?, adding, ?Any complaints of catcalling in the factory are thoroughly investigated and action is taken where necessary.?Tesla also said that at the meeting, ?there was a lot of energy around ensuring we are proactively sourcing diverse talent and ensuring that we have an interview and assessment process that is free from bias?.Vandermeyden said she talked briefly about her experience at the meeting, adding: ?It was finally giving women a venue to voice what was going on. It felt like Tesla had been saying I?m making all this up. And here were all the women saying, ?No, it?s happening.? It?s too big to deny.?Her lawsuit, filed last year, alleged that after she was hired in 2013, she was promoted to a manufacturing engineering position in a department that consisted mostly of men and where she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly assumed. Men were also granted positions over her, and she and other women were denied promotions despite their equal or superior qualifications, the complaint said. She also said that Tesla retaliated against her after she raised concerns about sexual harassment and catcalls she routinely faced on the factory floor. Vandermeyden went public with her story in an interview with the Guardian in February, prompting Tesla to vehemently deny her allegations, claiming that an internal investigation concluded that there was no harassment, discrimination or retaliation.On 23 May, Tesla announced the hiring of Gaby Toledano as the new chief people officer to oversee HR amid growing concerns about unsafe working conditions at the factory. Toledano joined as the only woman in the ?c-suite?, meaning group of chief executives.One of her first major acts was to fire Vandermeyden. I?m the one who spoke up, and they?re saying, ?One way or another, you have to leave.? How is that right?Toledano asked Vandermeyden to meet for coffee one-on-one without lawyers on 29 May, the Memorial Day holiday. Vandermeyden said she thought it was an opportunity to discuss ways to improve the workplace and address her concerns, but instead she was told she could resign and get a severance package or she would be terminated immediately and should not show up for work the next day.?It felt like they were trying to intimidate me. I?m the one who spoke up, and they?re saying, ?One way or another, you have to leave.? How is that right?? Vandermeyden recalled in the recent interview. Toledano?s message to her was clear, she added: ??You can end this now or this is going to be litigation going on for years.??She refused to resign and was fired, she said. She has yet to return to Tesla to clean out her desk.Tesla disputed Vandermeyden?s account of the meeting, saying: ?Gaby did not intimidate Ms Vandermeyden. She disagrees that there was any intimidation, nor did Ms Vandermeyden ever express feeling intimidated during the meeting. In fact, they both had a positive rapport and expressed mutual support, as Gaby was new to her role at Tesla and was attempting to resolve the matter in a positive and mutually supportive manner for the company and for Ms Vandermeyden.?Vandermeyden struggled to process the news and was further shocked when Tesla released a 430-word statement to the Guardian justifying the termination. ?Vandermeyden was given special treatment and opportunities for advancement that were unwarranted based on her qualifications, and that negatively impacted other more qualified individuals,? the statement said, saying that she behaved in a ?fundamentally false and misleading manner?. The company said she ?falsely attacked? Tesla in the press, amounting to a ?miscarriage of justice?, adding: ?It is impossible to trust anyone after they have behaved in such a manner.?Her lawyer, Therese Lawless, well known for fighting discrimination in Silicon Valley, said the statement was clear evidence that Tesla?s termination was retaliation for raising concerns about workplace conditions, which is her legally protected right.In addition to saying she was not qualified for her job, Tesla has also repeatedly noted that Vandermeyden did not have an engineering degree, a fact many tech journalists have repeated in articles. But according to Vandermeyden and another Tesla employee, this is not uncommon; she said she knew of at least two male engineers in her department without a degree.  Musk also appeared to reference Vandermeyden in a company-wide email sent two days after her termination. In the email ? with the subject ?Doing the right thing?, sent at 2.29am ? Musk lamented the scrutiny that his company faces, saying, ?The list of companies that want to kill Tesla is so long, I?ve lost track.?As as a result, he continued, employees must work harder and faster than competitors, adding they can?t be a ?jerk? in the process.Musk did not name Vandermeyden, but went on to offer what seemed to be a thinly veiled attack on her lawsuit: ?If you are part of a less represented group, you don?t get a free pass on being a jerk yourself. We have had a few cases at Tesla where someone in a less represented group was actually given a job or promoted over more qualified highly represented candidates and then decided to sue Tesla for millions of dollars because they felt they weren?t promoted enough. That is obviously not cool.? Vandermeyden, who had not seen the email until the Guardian provided it to her, said it was painful to read: ?It?s saying everything I?ve done at Tesla, all the hard work, it?s dismissing it all. It hurts because there are going to be some people who believe that.?She also noted that she has consistently received positive performance evaluations and called his email ?defamatory?.Asked about the email, Tesla said in a statement: ?This email in fact did not reference Ms Vandermeyden or her case.?Vandermeyden said she wished that Musk would consider that ?dissent isn?t disloyalty? and that her love of Tesla drove her to advocate for better working conditions. ?I was never your enemy,? she said, adding: ?I still believe in the importance of transitioning the world to sustainable energy, but now I don?t get to be a part of it.?She recalled getting a T-shirt with Musk as a superhero when she first joined Tesla, and that it was hard to realize that ?sometimes your superheroes aren?t always super?.', 'Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday hosted the Indian women?s team that finished runner-up at the ICC Women?s cricket World Cup and told the players that they made the nation proud like several other ?daughters? of the country.Modi had posted a series of tweets before the match to wish luck to the team and to players individually.

The estimated worth of the drugs seized from the accused is around Rs 50 crore.The discus thrower, identified as Harpreet Singh, won a silver medal at the 2004 Commonwealth Youth Games in Australia and a bronze at the 2006 South Asian Games, before a foot injury cut his career short. ?Harpreet?s career was marred with doping charges that had once also fetched him a six-month long ban,? Sanjeev Yadav, DCP (special cell) said.The other two arrested men were identified as athlete Amandeep Singh, who was pursuing a diploma in hospitality and tourism in London, and Hanish Sarpal who had enrolled in a management course at a university in London, but later dropped out.Harpreet and Amandeep were nabbed by a special cell team from New Delhi station on Wednesday evening, after the police were informed that the duo would be smuggling meow-meow drugs from Mumbai to the capital.Police said 25 kilos of Mephedrone was seized from the possession of the accused. Mephedrone is popular in parties and is used as a substitute for cocaine. Wednesday?s recovery was possibly the biggest seizure of the drugs from the national capital, police said.An officer said the interrogation of the duo led the police to Hanish, who was nabbed from west Delhi?s Janakpuri with another 650 grams of the same drug. Police claimed that their probe has revealed the drugs as smuggled from the African subcontinent to Mumbai and from there pushed into various Indian cities and even exported to other countries.

Officials said the agency placed the seven, including the relative of a government official, under arrest late yesterday under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).  Rs 93 lakh in new notes of Rs 2000 have been seized in the case, they added. Officials said the action was taken as part of a probe in a case where the Income Tax department had recently seized Rs 5.7 crore cash in new currency and the Enforcement Directorate had booked a money laundering case against a government engineer and others based on a CBI FIR in the case. The modus operandi adopted by the alleged middlemen, officials said, was unearthed after ED officials launched a special operation and themselves posed as customers looking to get old currency changed illegally, after paying commission to the said middlemen.

His comments suggest this would involve mutual adjustments or concessions, most likely in Tawang and Aksai Chin.\"China and India are now standing in front of the gate towards a final settlement,\" he said. \"The gate is a framework solution based on meaningful and mutually accepted adjustments.

The Uttar Pradesh government announced a similar service, as did a particular district in Madhya Pradesh over the last year. Raman Singh did not elaborate on how much the scheme will cost.On Sunday, Singh urged people to use panchagavya ? a concoction prepared by mixing constituents derived directly and indirectly from cows such as dung, urine, milk, curd and ghee ? and help promote the cow-based economy. ?Organic farming and biogas can help promote a cow-based economy,?

That\\'s largely because the National Space and Aeronautical Administration (NASA), the authority that controls space flights in the US, was investigating what went wrong with one of the missions that Chawla and her five other crew members had to undertake during their 15-day space odyssey in November last year. Chawla was assigned the task of releasing Spartan, the $10 million (Rs 40 crore) solar-physics satellite from the space shuttle\\'s bay. Either a systems malfunction or an error of judgement caused it to spin out of control and it took a daring space walk by the crew to retrieve it. NASA investigation showed it was the result of a series of small errors and absolved Chawla, calling her \"a terrific astronaut\". In an exclusive telephone interview from Houston, she spoke to Deputy Editor Raj Chengappa last week. Excerpts:Q. When you were first free from the clutches of gravity after lift-off, can you describe the physical and mental feeling?A. When you lift off the pressure is supposed to be maximum. But actually it was very benign. Very enjoyable. But as soon as the engines cut off and you get to zero gravity, you felt as if you were being pushed off your seat. You feel disoriented. You don\\'t feel aligned with anything. I felt for a few good hours that I was falling. In fact, you are in a free fall- that\\'s what zero gravity is all about. But the first few hours, the workload was so much that it was hard to realise the magic of the experience. But afterwards the feeling was literally out of this world.Q. What is the strangest thing about being in zero gravity?A. One of the strangest things is that when I was about to sleep, I realised I was only aware of my thoughts. Because you are weightless you don\\'t feel your legs or your body. In a sense then, you are just your intelligence. It\\'s amazing you can\\'t feel anything but your consciousness.Q. How did you feel about becoming the first Indian woman to be in space?A. I never truly thought of being the first or second someone. Or being a small-town girl. This is just something I wanted to do. It was very important for me to enjoy it. If you want to do something, what does it matter where you are ranked? Nor does being a woman make a difference. We were all just crew members.Q. Did looking down at the earth from space change your concept of it?A. It did. The first view of the earth is magical. All of us had grown fond of watching the Himalayas pass by. I saw the Brahmaputra and how it turned to meet the Ganges. And the Ganges delta looked very serene. What is mindboggling is the tremendous speed we were going at. We crossed the Himalayas in less than two minutes, and then you realise, \"Oh My God\" within an hour and a half, we have gone around the whole planet. It is a very overpowering realisation that the earth is so small. The atmosphere looks like a ribbon with different colours hugging the earth. That, in addition, lends so much to its fragility. It affected me. I could not get over the notion that in such a small planet, with such a small ribbon of life, so much goes on.Q. Did you think about Karnal or India?A. We passed over India lots of times. And sometimes I would think, oh I have been there. Especially while passing over New Delhi. You couldn\\'t really spot it but I pointed it out to my crew members and said I lived near there. But I really didn\\'t see countries by themselves, I just saw land.Q. Does the earth look all blue from up there?A. The earth is not just a bluish hue. You actually see all the colours. It was spectacular. For example, when the Sahara comes into view, the ocean near it is an emerald green. It is shockingly beautiful. The Sahara itself looks golden brown. Then you cross the Nile, and it looks like a deep, dark green ribbon and immediately you can tell why it is the lifeline of the desert.Q. How did it affect you? A. The nice thing about it is that if there are any blemishes, it is lost. Everything looks pretty. It is as if the whole place is sacred. You get the feeling that I need to work extraordinarily hard along with other human beings to respect that.Q. Do you see the pollution?A. I did see it and it was one of the unfortunate sights. For instance, you can see smokestacks. We saw fires, one over Australia. We also saw smog layers over Taiwan.Q. Did you long for Indian food when you were up in space?A. My crewmates, especially my Japanese colleague who loves curries, would say: \"How can you survive with the stuff we are eating here?\" I would just laugh it off. I didn\\'t miss it much.Q. Did you feel Indian or a sense of Indianness?A. To the contrary. On one of the night passes, I dimmed the lights in the flight deck and saw the stars. When you look at the stars and the galaxy, you feel that you are not just from any particular piece of land but from the solar system. I could extend the whole thing-maybe one day people will go to other galaxies and then what would we say? Where did we come from? I am a resident of the Milky Way?Q. What exactly happened during the Spartan satellite release manoeuvre? What malfunctioned?A. We don\\'t know about the malfunction part. NASA is looking into all these things. It isn\\'t one big thing but a number of small things that made us get to where we were at the end.Q. Were you hurt by some of the reports in the Indian media that blamed you?A. I just haven\\'t had the time to look at the reports. But NASA did not blame me at all. I wasn\\'t hurt because I figured that in the end everyone would know what the truth was.Q. What was your immediate feeling when things went wrong?A. At that time, one is so busy and focused on the task that one doesn\\'t feel anything. My immediate feeling was that we had 13 more days to go, with plenty of experiments that had nothing to do with the satellite. This included a space walk. And we had to focus on our mission and make the best of it.Q. When you returned, what was the first thing you wanted to do?A. I wanted to go on a canoeing trip and feel the wind in my face. That\\'s one thing you miss when you\\'re out there. I missed the fresh air.', 'Fifty years after homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, 72 other countries and territories worldwide continue to criminalise same-sex relationships, including 45 in which sexual relationships between women are outlawed.There are eight countries in which homosexuality can result in a death penalty, and dozens more in which homosexual acts can result in a prison sentence, according to an annual report by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA).Southern and east Africa, the Middle East and south Asia persist with the most draconian approaches. Western Europe and the western hemisphere are the most tolerant.But Britain was by no means a frontrunner when it moved 50 years ago to partly decriminalise homosexuality. Some 20 other countries had already led the way, including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Brazil and Argentina, all of whom had legalised it well before 1900.In Iran, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, homosexuality is still punishable by death, under sharia law. The same applies in parts of Somalia and northern Nigeria. In two other countries ? Syria and Iraq ? the death penalty is carried out by non-state actors, including Islamic State.The report notes that, although the potential exists for a death penalty to be handed down under sharia courts in at least five other countries ? Pakistan, Afghanistan, the UAE, Qatar and Mauritania ? there is no evidence suggesting that it has been implemented for consensual same-sex acts between adults in private.Same-sex relations ? which are variously criminalised under laws covering sodomy, buggery and ?acts against nature? among others ? could lead to a prison sentence in 71 states in all.However, this number excludes Egypt, where same-sex relations are technically legal but are vigorously pursued and where hundreds of people are reported to be detained on morality grounds.Altogether, more than 120 countries have decriminalised homosexuality. But some still cannot be described as liberal. Russia, for example, has recently introduced laws banning the promotion of homosexuality. Russia was recently rebuked by the European court of human rights for a 2013 law banning the spread of ?propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations? among minors.A co-author of the ILGA report, Aengus Carroll, said it remained the case that there was ?no country in the world where LGBT people are safe from discrimination, stigmatisation or violence?.?Legislative change is slow enough in coming, but societal attitudes, particularly those that may evoke taboo, are painstakingly slow,? he said. However, he pointed to some positive developments, in countries including Botswana, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Tunisia, where advocates have recently won court cases affirming the right to form organisations to lobby for rights.There have also been ?amazing strides? on sexual orientation and gender identity issues around the world.A parliamentary vote in Germany will lead to the legalisation of same-sex marriage later this year; marriage equality in Malta will bring to 24 the number of states allowing gay marriage. A similar number of states offer civil partnership recognition.At the time of publication of the ILGA report, there were 26 countries that allowed for joint adoption for same-sex couples and 27 in which same-sex second parent adoption ? where a same-sex parent can legally become a step-parent to his or her partner?s child ? was in place.A spokesman for the LGBT charity Stonewall said that, while it was important to remember how far the UK had come on LGBT rights since the 1967 Sexual Offences Act, many challenges remained.?Same-sex relations are illegal in 72 countries, and punishable by death in eight. We all have a part to play in ensuring all LGBT people are accepted without exception and all we can hope is that, in 50 more years, we will have lots more progress to look back on,? said Matt Horwood. ?Trans people still face a number of legal barriers and LGBT people as a whole continue to face discrimination in their daily lives.

They say the same strict measures must be applied to cars.NOx pollution is responsible for tens of thousands of early deaths across Europe, with the UK suffering a particularly high toll. Much of the pollution is produced by diesel cars, which on the road emit about six times more than allowed in the official lab-based tests. Following the Volkswagen ?dieselgate? scandal, the car tests are due to be toughened, but campaigners say the reforms do not go far enough.The new report from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), a research group that played a key role in exposing Volkswagen?s cheating, compared the emissions from trucks and buses in realistic driving conditions with those of cars.It found that heavy-duty vehicles tested in Germany and Finland emitted about 210mg NOx per kilometre driven, less than half the 500mg/km pumped out by modern diesel cars that meet the highest ?Euro 6? standard. However, the buses and trucks have larger engines and burn more diesel per kilometre, meaning that cars produce 10 times more NOx per litre of fuel.The ICCT analysis showed that manufacturers were able to ensure that heavy duty vehicles kept below pollution limits when on the road, but that emissions from cars soar once in the real world.Official EU tests for cars are currently limited to laboratory measurements of prototype vehicles. ?In contrast, for measurement of NOx emissions from trucks and buses, mobile testing devices became mandatory in 2013. As a consequence, randomly selected vehicles can be tested under real-world driving conditions,? said Peter Mock, managing director of ICCT in Europe.Changes to the car testing regime in the EU are due to start in September, with mobile devices, called portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS), attached to vehicles as they drive on real roads. But Mock warned: ?Manufacturers will still be allowed to carefully select special prototype cars for emissions testing. Instead, it would be much better to measure the emissions of ordinary mass-production vehicles, obtained from customers who have had been driving them in an ordinary way.? Such a system is used in the US where the dieselgate scandal first emerged. It will also be put forward for discussion by the European commission on 17 January in Brussels, but the ICCT said it faces resistance from some vehicle manufacturers and EU member states.In December, the European commission started legal action against the UK and six other EU states for failing to act against car emissions cheating in the wake of the dieselgate scandal. But later the same month, a draft European parliament inquiry found the European commission itself guilty of maladministration for failing to act quickly enough on evidence that defeat devices were being used to game emissions tests.Evidence that some diesel cars emitted up to four times more NOx pollution than a bus was revealed in 2015. Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP and a lead negotiator on the EU?s air quality law, said ?It is disgraceful that car manufacturers have failed to reduce deadly emissions when the technology to do so is affordable and readily available. The dramatic reduction in NOx emissions from heavier vehicles is a result of far stricter EU tests, in place since 2011, that reflect real-world driving conditions. If buses and trucks can comply with these limits, there?s no reason cars can?t as well.??

The Opposition has already named Gandhi's grandson Gopalkrishna Gandhi as its choice for the vice-presidential post. Both Venkaiah Naidu and Gopalkrishna Gandhi have filed their nominations for the vice-presidential election today. Of them, one will succeed Hamid Ansari as vice-president and will also be the chairman of Rajya Sabha. In the past, there have been several instances when the Vice-President of India went on to become the President.While no one knows if history will repeat itself in near future, we take a look at six such people who were first elected as vice-president and later became the country's president.1) Dr S RadhakrishnanIn 1952, Dr S Radhakrishnan and Janab Shaik Khadir Hussain filed nominations for vice-presidential election. The Returning Officer found Radhakrishnan's nomination valid and declared him unopposed to the office of the vice-president on April 25, 1952. After two terms as vice-president, Dr Radhakrishnan was elected as the second President of India in 1962. 2) Dr Zakir HussainBefore Dr Radhakrishnan's term as vice-president ended, elections were held to choose his successor. While Dr Zakir Hussain polled 568 votes, N C Samantsinhar secured 14 votes. Dr Hussain assumed the office of vice-president on May 13, 1962. He later succeded Dr Radhakrishnan as the third President of India in 1967 and remained in office till his untimely death in May 1969.3) V V GiriAfter Dr Zakir Hussain, V V Giri succeeded him as the vice-president of India in 1967. In the vice-presidential election, Giri got 483 votes against 193 votes for Professor Mohammad Habib.V V Giri assumed the office of vice-president on May 13, 1967. Following Dr Hussain's death in 1969, Giri also took charge as the acting president. He resigned from both the posts, vice-president and acting president, to contest the presidential election. Giri faced stiff competition from N Sanjeeva Reddy but eventually managed to get past the required quota of votes in the second count. Giri was sworn in as the President of India on August 24, 1969.4) R VenkataramanRamaswami Venkataraman assumed the office of vice-president on August 31, 1984. In the vice-presidential election, he secured an easy win over Bapu Chandrasen Kamble, and succeeded M Hidayatullah to the post. In 1987, R Venkataraman succeeded Gyani Zail Singh as the next President. 5) Dr Shankar Dayal SharmaAfter R Venkataram was elected as the President, he tendered his resignation as the vice-president. The election for the post was announced and 27 candidates filed their nomination. On scrutiny, the Returning Officer found only one nomination valid, that of Shankar Dayal Sharma. He was elected unopposed to the post of vice-president and assumed office on September 3, 1987. He fought the presidential election of 1992 and beat competition from G G Swell and Ram Jethmalani. Shankar Dayal Sharma succeeded R Venkataraman as the president and assumed office on July 25, 1992. 6) K R NarayananShankar Dayal Sharma resigned as vice-president after becoming the President, and elections were announced. K R Narayanan won the vice-presidential election with an overwhelming margin and secured 700 of the 701 valid votes. He was declared elected on August 19, 1992. In the 1997 presidential election, K R Narayanan defeated T N Seshan with a huge margin to succeed Shankar Dayal Sharma as the next president.

The girl was rescued by the West Bengal Police from brothel number 56, which is owned by a couple lodged in Tihar jail. Afaq Husain and Saria Begum have been allegedly trafficking girls and forcing them into prostitution for the past 17 years. They have been arrested at least seven times in the past and are currently booked under the non-bailable Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). However, this has failed to stop the racket they run at Delhi?s red light district ? GB Road. Monday?s rescue operation came after raids at the same brothel in August in which the couple was arrested. It raised questions on the crime branch?s claim that the prostitution syndicate run by the couple had been busted.The rescued girl, who is from Durgapur in West Bengal, was trafficked in 2014 and forced into prostitution. ?The girl took a mobile phone from a customer and called her father. We traced the location through the phone call and contacted the local police. The girl was rescued from the brothel,? said Umakant of the West Bengal Police, who is the investigating officer in the case.According to the Delhi Police crime branch, over 80% business at GB Road is controlled by two-three operators, who have their own network of agents. Afaq and Saria are allegedly the influential operators who control everything from a distant location through handpicked brothel managers.?The fact that the Delhi Police had raided the same place in August 2016, when this girl was probably confined there, says a lot about the nexus of the traffickers. Instead of just arresting the traffickers, the police must break the nexus,? said Rishi Kant of the Shakti Vahini NGO, who assisted the West Bengal Police in the operation.The crime branch admitted that girls are sold to the brothel owners for Rs 1 lakh and the victims are confined in hidden cells, thrashed, intoxicated, starved and forced into commercial activity.?While the victims are compelled to live in terrible conditions, their distressed family members keep running from pillar to post to trace them. The crime branch studied the crime pattern to institute effective action against the key perpetrators and real beneficiaries of this illegal trade,? the crime branch said in August.The Delhi Police has also proposed to seal the brothel owned by the couple and the matter is pending in the court.?At the time of rescue, our team had asked the girls if they wanted to come with us as there are many adult girls who prefer to stay. Those, who agreed, were rescued while the rest were allowed to stay.

People wait at bus stops for a minimum of 10 minutes in Delhi and this would also ensure safety of commuters, especially women,? a transport official said. The project has been pegged at a cost of Rs140 crore, which will be taken from the Nirbhaya Fund. ?The government has already received in-principle approval for its share from the fund from the ministry of home affairs.

', 'No matter what time you leave for work, chances are you will get stuck in the Capital?s traffic. A study by the Centre for Science and Environment has found that ?non-peak hours? have almost disappeared on Delhi?s main arterial roads, i.e., there is virtually no difference in travel time between peak and non-peak hours. The month-long CSE study on travel time and traffic speed monitored 13 arterial roads for 12 hours daily. While the average morning and evening peak speeds were recorded at 28kmph and 25kmph, the off-peak speed remained restricted to 27kmph. The analysis, which is based on data from Google Maps, shows that roads in Delhi are more congested on weekends, with an average peak speed of 25kmph, less than the weekday figure of 26kmph.  It was found that vehicles are plying 50%-60% slower than the speed these roads were built for.The 13 arterial roads that were part of the study included heavily congested ones such as Outer Ring Road; Swaroop Nagar to Wazirabad, Mahatma Gandhi Road (Ring Road); Indira Gandhi Stadium Complex to Majnu Ka Tilla and Sri Aurobindo Marg; Lado Sarai to Kidwai Nagar West. Arterial roads are primary networks that provide long-distance travel through multi-modal transport system connecting all major city-level land uses. They also facilitate inter-city and regional trips by connecting with highways and expressway networks.The analysis was done on the basis of data taken from Google Maps that was noted for every hour from 8 am to 8 pm in June.Traffic speedThe study found that all the 13 selected arterial roads had an average peak speed of 26 km/hr, while the off-peak speed was recorded at 27 km/hr, which is 50%-60% lower than the design speed. These roads have been designed to achieve a driving speed of 50-70 km/hr as per the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) street design guidelines as well as Indian Road Congress guidelines for urban roads. The regulated speed is 40-55 km/hour.It was also seen that during the 12 hours of the day, around 75% of the time, the average speed is 25-30 km/hr. About 17% of the time, it is 20-25 km/hr and only 8% of the day?s time was the speed more than 30 km/hr.According to a 2010 report by RITES, the average peak speed in Delhi was 27.7 km/hr and off-peak was 30.8 km/hr ? now, this has come down to 26 km/hr and 28 km/hr.Weekends more congestedThe analysis breaks the myth that Delhi?s roads have less traffic during weekends. The analysis says that the average peak speed noted during weekends on these roads is 25 km/hr which is lower than the weekday speed of 26 km/hr. ?This even drops to 8 km/hr on Sri Aurobindo Marg and 9 km/hr on Mehrauli-Badarpur road during peak hours. Evening peaks are worse during weekends ? 21-23 km/hr in contrast to 25-27 km/hr on working days,? said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy, CSE.While the average traffic speed on Saturday is 21 km/hour, on Sunday it improves slightly to 23 km/hour but remains still worse than weekdays, she added.Lutyens? roads less congested The study states that the average traffic speed in Lutyen?s Zone, which has primary arterial roads with widths up to 50 meters, is considerably higher. The average peak hour speed is 44 km/hr ? almost 40% higher than on other arterial roads. The average off-peak speed is 52 km/hr, which is almost double that on other arterials. There is also a considerable difference between the average peak and off-peak speed. Air pollution worsens with trafficCSE also analysed hourly air quality data for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) ? largely influenced by traffic ? for a selected day. It found that when the average morning peak speed of 28 km/hr drops to 25 km/hr in the evening, NO2 levels increase from 68 microgramme/cubic metre to 94 microgramme/cubic metre ? an increase of 38%. ?This can get worse during winter when inversion builds up during evening,? Roychowdhury said. Traffic from NCR citiesMost of the arterial roads are conduit for traffic from the neighboring NCR cities, the study states. Besides, there are some stretches that are chronically congested. On the stretch from Ambedkar Nagar to Lajpat Nagar on Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg, the average morning and evening peak speed was 16 km/hr and 17 km/hr. ?Speed can even drop to 5 km/hr during evening hours. On Sri Aurobindo Marg from Lado Sarai to Kidwai Nagar West, the average speed is 19 km/hr during the worst peak hours between 6 pm and 7 pm; during weekends it can drop to 7 km/hr,? she added.', 'When you think of a beauty pageant as reputed as Miss Universe, you probably don\\'t think that those who don\\'t fit into the stereotype of beauty will be allowed to enter it.

Tillerson told the Independent Journal Review (IJR), in an interview conducted on his official plane during the three-nation Asia trip. ?My wife told me I?m supposed to do this.?He said he had not met Donald Trump before being summoned to Trump Tower after the surprise election victory, ostensibly to talk to the president-elect ?about the world? and his experiences as an oil company CEO.?When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned,? he said, adding that at 65 years old, at the end of a four-decade career at ExxonMobil, he had expected to retire: ?I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids.?However, he said that when he returned to his Texas home after meeting Trump in New York, his wife, Renda St Clair, shook her finger in his face and said: ?I told you God?s not through with you.?He said he now feels his wife had been right: ?I?m supposed to do this.?Not everyone shares that view. Tillerson has been the subject of heavy criticism since taking the post as the country?s top diplomat at the beginning of February. He was left out of the loop of several critical foreign policy decisions made in the administration?s early days, most importantly the travel ban for refugees and visitors from a list of Muslim countries.He has also almost totally dodged the press for the first few weeks in his job. He did not take the Washington diplomatic press corps with him on his Asia tour, breaking with decades-old practice. The sole exception was the journalist from the IJR, a little-known outlet founded by a former Republican operative. The initial explanation from the state department was that he wanted to save money and take a smaller plane than usual. In his interview, Tillerson repeated that explanation but also suggested it would be his policy to avoid the press until and unless he had a specific message to deliver.He told the IJR: ?I?m not a big media press access person. I personally don?t need it. I understand it?s important to get the message of what we?re doing out, but I also think there?s only a purpose in getting the message out when there?s something to be done.?When questioned about Russia, the IJR reported: ?He was so cagey ? his answer wasn?t even worthy of inclusion.?Tillerson has also been criticised for failing to defend the state department vocally enough in the face of a threatened budget cut of up to a third. Senior Republicans have said the cuts to diplomacy and foreign aid proposed by the White House would not pass Congress. In his remarks to the IJR, however, Tillerson appeared to relish the management challenge of cutting down the size of the US diplomatic establishment.?Looking at ongoing conflicts, if we accept that we?re just going to continue to never solve any of these conflicts, then the budget should stay at the current level,? he said. He said he had not yet talked to Trump about what a pared-down state department would look like or how it will be staffed: ?We haven?t gotten that far yet.?While in South Korea, Tillerson was reported in the Seoul press to have snubbed the government by telling Korean officials he was too tired to dine with them. In response, he accused his hosts of being deliberately misleading. ?They never invited us for dinner, then at the last minute they realised that optically it wasn?t playing very well in public for them, so they put out a statement that we didn?t have dinner because I was tired,? he told the IJR. On Tuesday, the state department was fighting off a new controversy, after it emerged Tillerson would skip what would have been his first Nato foreign ministers? meeting in early April in Brussels so he could be in Florida for Trump?s first meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The state department spokesman, Mark Toner, insisted the administration was 100% committed to Nato and that Tillerson would be meeting many member foreign ministers at the anti-Isis meeting in Washington on Wednesday. Toner said the state department had proposed new dates for a possible Nato meeting.', 'SS Rajamouli, who currently awaits the release of his much-anticipated film Baahubali: The Conclusion, went on the record saying that he would love to make a film on Mahabharat.Speaking at India Today Conclave South 2017, Rajamouli said, \"My dream has always been to do Mahabharata on a scale not attempted ever.\"ALSO READ: After piracy threat, Suriya asks fans to watch Singam 3 in theatresALSO READ: Sasikala vs Panneerselvam: 5 film roles Chinnamma will fit perfectly inNow, an interesting update about the film has cropped up.

However, the culture of Indian politics since independence, has sadly taken this shape,\" he told a meet the press programme here. \"I have not changed my views on this and my party also know this. Debate and discussion should be held in Parliament and not disruption,\" the former UN diplomat said. He was reacting on stalling of the House by Opposition over the demonetisation issue.

The administration that was caught unawares had cleaned up some of the toilets. But many others that were still in poor condition.The minister was clearly upset after spotting tissue papers littered all over the floor of one washroom and started cleaning it himself. He then hauled up SAI administrator Manjushree Roy.Roy tried to control the situation by putting the onus on the Wrestling Federation of India that is hosting the Asian Wrestling Championships at the stadium\\'s KD Jadhav indoor hall. But Goel was not satisfied with her response.The anxiety on Roy\\'s face was palpable as the minister\\'s personal assistant kept taking note of everything and also clicked pictures of the dirty corners.

I have visited almost all the stadiums, except this one. I had come here two-three days ago. Today, everything is clean.

Now, the project is being carried on in a planned, scientific and implementable manner and any obstruction in that behalf will not be tolerated,? the bench said.The tribunal reconstituted the principal committee, formed to see the execution of the cleaning of the Yamuna, and included Shashi Shekhar, former secretary of ministry of water resources, as a special invitee.It also convened a meeting of stakeholders, including officials from Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, on August 8 at 3pm at the tribunal to discuss the cleaning and rejuvenation of the Yamuna.During the hearing, the counsel appearing for the Delhi government told the NGT that steps were being taken by the Delhi Jal Board to ensure that work to clean the Yamuna was completed with utmost expeditiousness.?In relation to the project report of the second phase of the Yamuna cleaning, it is submitted that it has already been filed before the tribunal as well as sent to the principal committee, ministry of water resources,? the bench noted.The directions came when the NGT was hearing a plea on the monitoring of implementation of the Maili se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalisation Project 2017 project.The tribunal had earlier banned open defecation and dumping of waste on the floodplains of the Yamuna and announced an environment compensation of R5,000 for violation of the order.', 'India, out of all countries, has seen what blind faith can do.

Curious villagers also joined the 30-year-old fellow at Warangal-Hyderabad highway and started digging in the middle of the road with the help of JCBs and shovels.

The problem has been compounded as the data was not backed up.The portal was maintained by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). To make matters worse, CVC\\'s contract with TCS expired in December. There is no annual maintenance contract either between CVC and TCS.The sources said after the grave tragedy, the Centre\\'s web services organisation, National Informatics Centre (NIC), took over the maintenance of the CVC\\'s portal this year. NIC has also been trying to retrieve the old data but without much success.All efforts to talk to senior officials of CVC such as vigilance commissioners Rajiv and TM Bhasin, secretary Nilam Sawhney, additional secretary Salim Haque and director Jyoti Trivedi were in vain.Though new complaints can now be made with CVC and their details would be available, the particulars of almost all the previous cases have been permanently erased.ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION IN NTCOne of those cases pertain to alleged massive corruption in National Textile Corporation (NTC) under the Union Ministry of Textiles, now headed by Smriti Irani.Mumbai-based whistleblower HR Kosia had filed an RTI application with CVC in 2013 demanding action taken report in an alleged corruption case. He had accused NTC chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) PC Vaish of selling a godown for a song to a private party in 2013.According to Kosia\\'s complaint, Vaish, then NTC\\'s director, finance, had sold off Mumbai-based Poddar Process Malharvadi Kalbadevi worth crores to private builders Om Vastu Shanti for mere Rs 75 lakh. The transaction was allegedly done without due tendering process or without approval from Textiles Ministry and NTC\\'s Board of Directors.The deal was done despite the fact that NTC had won a case against lease holder (Poddar Process) in 2013 when Vaish was finance director.Kosia, who was deputy manager (security and vigilance) with NTC, had to pay a heavy price for bringing to light this corruption and several other cases of irregularities in the Corporation. He was dismissed from service in July, 2016.Kosia\\'s grievance is that the Textiles Ministry neither filed any chargesheet against him nor lodged an FIR nor had a \\'panchnama\\' done.SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS IN CVCFinally, Kosia filed an RTI in the Commission. After several communications, CVC director and Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) Jyoti Trivedi replied on December 22, 2016, saying that \"due to technical problem in the working of complaint portal of the Commission, it is not possible to provide the action taken on your complaint at this stage\".She added that the appellate authority in the matter was CVC additional secretary Praveen Sinha.Kosia petitioned Sinha, saying that the CPIO\\'s response was not legally valid as per RTI Act 2005. Sinha replied to Kosia on January 24, and admitted that the \"corruption case lodged with CVC required action taken reports copy\".In his decision, Sinha said, \"I have gone through the relevant records and find that at the time of giving a reply to the appellant (Kosia), the complaint portal was not functioning and this position was intimated to the appellant by the CPIO.\"I direct the CPIO concerned (Jyoti Trivedi) to confirm the position regarding complaints mentioned by the appellant in his RTI application and provide an appropriate reply to him within 15 days of the receipt of these orders,\" he said.Sinha further said, \"The issues raised by the appellant have thus been addressed appropriately. However, if the appellant is not satisfied with the above decision, he can make an appeal with the Central Information Commission (CIC). The appeal is accordingly disposed (of).\"Following the appellate authority\\'s decision, Jyoti Trivedi sent a second reply to Kosia. In her letter dated February 9, she said, \"TCS system of the Commission is still not working. It is not possible to provide the action taken on your complaints at this stage.\"Kosia has now made a second appeal to CIC. He also apprehends some major conspiracy behind the whole episode. \"The portal crashing on November 28, CVC\\'s contract with TCS ending just next month, no AMC either between the two and there is no back up of data - all these cannot be coincidences. There is more to it than meets the eye. The PM should have an inquiry ordered into it,\" he said. The fate of Kosia\\'s application is uncertain and so does that of thousands of such cases.

He is not authoritative.\"\"Contrary to perception and allegations by some PM Modi is not centralised. He wants to make it true federal system in the country. He has the moral authority to do it,\" Mehbooba said.Mehbooba was in discussion with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.Mehbooba also said that the Centre and the state government both need to think about phasing out AFSPA from the Kashmir Valley.Inviting the businessmen and investors from Mumbai in Kashmir Valley, Mehbooba said, \"Kashmir is the safest place for women even when encounters are taking place. Come not only to invest. Come to Kashmir with your families.\"FADNAVIS AS DEFENCE MINISTER?Taking part in the India Today Conclave 2017 in Mumbai, Devendra Fadnavis kept everyone guessing about him being moving to Delhi as a Union Minister.Responding to a query about the speculation that he could be the next Defence Minister, Fadnavis said, \"India Today Conclave has shifted from New Delhi to Mumbai. Why do you want me to move from Mumbai to Delhi?\"But, Fadnavis immediately added, \"I am a true soldier of party. Whatever our Prime Minister and party president tells me to do, I am ready to do.\"\"Right now I have a job on hand. I am a Chief Minister now. I have Maharashtra on my agenda.\"\\'ONLY FARMERS DON\\'T COMMIT SUICIDE\\'Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan asserted that his state no longer belonged to BIMARU state after registering double digit GDP growth rate in the last seven years.Chouhan tried to play down the issue of farmers\\' suicide in Madhya Pradesh saying, \"Only farmers are not committing suicide. Students and businessmen are also committing suicide.\"\"All suicides by the farmers are not due to loan or crop failure. There are other reasons also for farmers\\' suicide. We remain committed to ameliorate the living conditions of farmers,\" Chouhan said.THE GST QUESTIONResponding to a query about will July 1 deadline for GST be met, Fadnavis said, \"Yes, I am confident. The deadline will be met. GST council has approved it. If political disruption is the motive then I can\\'t say anything.\"\"GST will create a common market. When VAT was introduced, there were concerns and apprehensions were expressed. VAT was a barrier regime. Now we are shifting to non-barrier regime. Barriers were artificially created,\" Fadnavis said.\"We are manufacturing state. As a big manufacturing state, we will lose something. But, at the same time being a big state, we are a big consumer state and there we will gain something,\" said Fadnavis.\"If some states lose more, then we must think that we are one nation. If some backward state gains and some better doing states are losing out, they should be happy. The GST will bring level playing field for everyone. Every state will gain with GST,\" Fadnavis added.APPRECIATE REGIONAL ASPIRATIONSJammu and Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti once again defended Article 370. She said every state has a unique situation. Maharashtra has Article 371 there, Jammu and Kashmir has Article 371, she said.\"You cannot do away with the regional aspirations. You have seen it after Mandal commission report. You have seen groups of Yadavs, rise of Mayawati and others,\" Mehbooba said.\"For us in Kashmir, India is not a country. It is a universe for us. It is full of diversity, different aspirations and all co-exist.

I did not see anyone complaining about demonetisation. No one showed anger.', 'The Kerala high court on Monday rejected the bail plea of Malayalam superstar Dileep, who was arrested two weeks ago in connection with the attack and sexual assault on a popular woman actor. Rejecting the bail plea, the court said it was a serious case and his release at this juncture would affect the ongoing investigation. The court agreed with the prosecution that if he was released he would influence some of the witnesses. The prosecution said many involved in the case including his manager Apunni were absconding. The court also approved scientific evidences presented by the prosecution.The actor had moved the high court after Angamally judicial magistrate court rejected his bail plea last week. His counsel said he would move the Supreme Court soon.

During the attack, the main accused, Pulsar Suni, reportedly hinted that they were committing the crime at somebody else?s behest.After the actor lodged a complaint, police arrested all the accused directly involved in the crime. An investigation aimed at identifying the conspirators behind the attack finally led to Dileep?s arrest two weeks ago.

I extend my warm greetings to everyone on this occasion. 2. Madam Speaker, our Government was elected amidst huge expectations of the people. The underlying theme of countless expectations was good governance. The expectations included burning issues like inflation and price rise, corruption in day to day transactions and crony capitalism. There was also expectation for a major change in the way the country\\'s natural resources were allocated, processed and deployed.3. In the last two and half years, it has been our mission to bring a Transformative Shift in the way our country is governed. We have moved Inflation, which was in double digits, has been controlled; sluggish growth has been replaced by high growth; and a massive war against black money has been launched. We have worked tirelessly on all these fronts and feel encouraged by the unstinted support of the people to our initiatives.Â\\xa0 The Government is now seen as a trusted custodian of public money.I take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the people of India for their strong support.4. We shall continue to undertake many more measures to ensure that the fruits of growth reach the farmers, the workers, the poor, the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, women and other vulnerable sections of our society. Our focus will be on energising our youth to reap the benefits of growth and employment.5. Madam Speaker, I am presenting this Budget when the world economy faces considerable uncertainty, in the aftermath of major economic and political developments during the last one year.Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that world GDP will grow by 3.1% in 2016 and 3.4% in 2017. The advanced economies are expected to increase their growth from 1.6% to 1.9% and the emerging economies from 4.1% to 4.5%. As per current indications, macro-economic policy is expected to be more expansionary in certain large economies. Growth in a number of emerging economies is expected to recover in 2017, after relatively poor performance in 2016.These are positive signs and point to an optimistic outlook for the next year.Also read: Union Budget 2017-18: List of things to cost more, less6.There are, however, three major challenges for emerging economies.&First, the current monetary policy stance of the US Federal Reserve, to increase the policy rates more than once in 2017, may lead to lower capital inflows and higher outflows from the emerging economies.Second, the uncertainty around commodity prices, especially that of crude oil, has implications for the fiscal situation of emerging economies. It is however expected that increase, if any, in oil prices would get tempered by quick response from producers of shale gas and oil. This would have a sobering impact on prices of crude and petroleum. Third, in several parts of the world, there are signs of increasing retreat from globalisation of goods, services and people, as pressures for protectionism are building up.These developments have the potential to affect exports from a number of emerging markets, including India. 7. Amidst all these developments, India stands out as a bright spot in the world economic landscape. India\\'s macro-economic stability continues to be the foundation of economic success. CPI inflation declined from 6% in July 2016 to 3.4% in December, 2016 and is expected to remain within RBI\\'s mandated range of 2% to 6%. Favourable price developments reflect prudent macro-economic management, resulting in higher agricultural production, especially in pulses. India\\'s Current Account Deficit declined from about 1% of GDP last year to 0.3% of GDP in the first half of 2016-17. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) increased from Rs1,07,000 crores in the first half of last year to Rs1,45,000 crores in the first half of 2016-17. This marks an increase by 36%, despite 5% reduction in global FDI inflows. Foreign exchange reserves have reached 361 billion US Dollars as on 20th January, 2017, which represents a comfortable cover for about 12 months of imports. 8. The Government has also continued on the steady path of fiscal consolidation, without compromising on the public investment requirements of the economy. Externally, the economy successfully weathered a number of shocks, the redemption of FCNR deposits, volatility from the US elections and the Fed rate hike. According to IMF forecast, India is expected to be one of the fastest growing major economies in 2017. 9. A number of global reports and assessments, over the last two years, have shown that India has considerably improved its policies, practices and economic profile. These are reflected in Doing Business Report of the World Bank; World Investment Report 2016 of UNCTAD; Global Competitiveness Report of 2015-16 and 2016-17 of the World Economic Forum; and several other Reports. India has become the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world, up from ninth previously. We are seen as an engine of global growth.Also read: Union Budget 2017: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley gives a boost to affordable housing10. In the last one year, our country has witnessed historic and impactful economic reforms and policy making. In fact, India was one of the very few economies undertaking transformational reforms. There were two tectonic policy initiatives, namely, passage of the Constitution Amendment Bill for GST and the progress for its implementation ; and demonetisation of high denomination bank notes. The advantages of GST for our economy in terms of spurring growth, competitiveness, indirect tax simplification and greater transparency have already been extensively discussed in both Houses of Parliament. I thank all Members of both the Houses for having passed the Constitution Amendment unanimously. I also thank the State Governments for resolving all relevant issues in the GST Council.11. Demonetisation of high denomination bank notes was in continuation of a series of measures taken by our Government during the last two years. It is a bold and decisive measure. For several decades, tax evasion for many has become a way of life. This compromises the larger public interest and creates unjust enrichment in favour of the tax evader, to the detriment of the poor and deprived. This has bred a parallel economy which is unacceptable for an inclusive society. Demonetisation seeks to create a new \\'normal\\' wherein the GDP would be bigger, cleaner and real. This exercise is part of our Government\\'s resolve to eliminate corruption, black money, counterfeit currency and terror funding. Like all reforms, this measure is obviously disruptive, as it seeks to change the retrograde status quo. Drop in economic activity, if any, on account of the currency squeeze during the remonetisation period is expected to have only a transient impact on the economy. I am reminded here of what the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, had said: \"A right cause never fails\". 12. Demonetisation has strong potential to generate long-term benefits in terms of reduced corruption, greater digitisation of the economy, increased flow of financial savings and greater formalisation of the economy, all of which would eventually lead to higher GDP growth and tax revenues. Demonetisation helps to transfer resources from the tax evaders to the Government, which can use these resources for the welfare of the poor and the deprived. There is early evidence of an increased capacity of Banks to lend at reduced interest rates and a huge shift towards digitisation among all sections of society. We firmly believe that demonetisation and GST which were built on the third transformational achievement of our Government, namely, the JAM vision, will have an epoch making impact on our economy and the lives of our people. 13. Madam Speaker, we are at an important turning point in the path of our growth and development.Â\\xa014. The pace of remonetisation has picked up and will soon reach comfortable levels. The effects of demonetisation are not expected to spill over into the next year. Thus IMF, even while revising India\\'s GDP forecast for 2016 downwards, has projected a GDP growth of 7.2% and 7.7% in 2017 and 2018 respectively. The World Bank, however, is more optimistic and has projected a GDP growth of 7% in 2016-17, 7.6% in 2017-18 and 7.8% in 2018-19. This pick up in our economy is premised upon our policy and determination to continue with economic reforms; increase in public investment in infrastructure and development projects; and export growth in the context of the expected rebound in world economy. The surplus liquidity in the banking system, created by demonetisation, will lower borrowing costs and increase the access to credit. This will boost economic activity, with multiplier effects. Also read: Union Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley caps cash donation to political parties at Rs 200015. The announcements made by Honourable Prime Minister on 31st December, 2016 address many of the key concerns of our economy at this juncture, such as, housing for the poor; relief to farmers; credit support to MSMEs; encouragement to digital transactions; assistance to pregnant women and senior citizens; and priority to dalits, tribals, backward classes and women under the Mudra Yojana.16. My overall approach, while preparing this Budget, has been to spend more in rural areas, infrastructure and poverty alleviation and yet maintain the best standards of fiscal prudence. I have also kept in mind the need to continue with economic reforms, promote higher investments and accelerate growth. 17. The last one year was a witness to other major reforms, namely, enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code; amendment to the RBI Act for inflation targeting; enactment of the Aadhar bill for disbursement of financial subsidies and benefits; significant reforms in FDI policy; the job creating package for textile sector; and several other measures. We will continue the process of economic reforms for the benefit of the poor and the underprivileged. 18. Madam Speaker, the Budget for 2017-18 contains three major reforms. First, the presentation of the Budget has been advanced to 1st February to enable the Parliament to avoid a Vote on Account and pass a single Appropriation Bill for 2017-18, before the close of the current financial year. This would enable the Ministries and Departments to operationalise all schemes and projects, including the new schemes, right from the commencement of the next financial year. They would be able to fully utilise the available working season before the onset of the monsoon. Second, the merger of the Railways Budget with the General Budget is a historic step. We have discontinued the colonial practice prevalent since 1924. This decision brings the Railways to the centre stage of Government\\'s fiscal policy and would facilitate multi modal transport planning between railways, highways and inland waterways. The functional autonomy of Railways will, however, continue. Third, we have done away with the plan and non-plan classification of expenditure. This will give us a holistic view of allocations for sectors and ministries. This would facilitate optimal allocation of resources.19. Madam Speaker, we are aware that we need to do more for our people. Continuing with the task of fulfilling the people\\'s expectations, our agenda for the next year is : \"Transform, Energise and Clean India\", that is, TEC India. This agenda of TEC India seeks to I propose to present my Budget proposals under ten distinct themes to foster this broad agenda. The themes are : (i) Farmers : for whom we have committed to double the income in 5 years;(ii) Rural Population : providing employment and basic infrastructure; (iii) Youth : energising them through education, skills and jobs;(iv) Poor and the Underprivileged : strengthening the systems of social security, health care and affordable housing; (v) Infrastructure: for efficiency, productivity and quality of life;(vi) Financial Sector : growth and stability through stronger institutions; (vii) Digital Economy :for speed, accountability and transparency;(viii) Public Service : effective governance and efficient service delivery through people\\'s participation;(ix) Prudent Fiscal Management : to ensure optimal deployment of resources and preserve fiscal stability; and(x)Tax Administration : honouring the honest. I. FARMERS20. The Indian farmer has once again shown his commitment and resilience in the current year. The total area sown under kharif and rabi seasons are higher than the previous year. With a better monsoon, agriculture is expected to grow at 4.1% in the current year. 21. In last year\\'s Budget speech, I focused on \\'income security\\' of farmers to double their income in 5 years. I had also announced a number of measures. We have to take more steps and enable the farmers to increase their production and productivity; and to deal with post-harvest challenges. 22. For a good crop, adequate credit should be available to farmers in time.Â\\xa0 The target for agricultural credit in 2017-18 has been fixed at a record level of Rs10 lakh crores. We will take special efforts to ensure adequate flow of credit to the under serviced areas, the Eastern States and Jammu & Kashmir. The farmers will also benefit from 60 days\\' interest waiver announced by Honourable Prime Minister in respect of their loans from the cooperative credit structure.23. About 40% of the small and marginal farmers avail credit from the cooperative structure. The Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) act as the front end for loan disbursements. We will support NABARD for computerisation and integration of all 63,000 functional PACS with the Core Banking System of District Central Cooperative Banks. This will be done in 3 years at an estimated cost of Rs 1,900 crores, with financial participation from State Governments. This will ensure seamless flow of credit to small and marginal farmers.24. At the time of sowing, farmers should feel secure against natural calamities. The Fasal Bima Yojana launched by our Government is a major step in this direction.Â\\xa0 The coverage of this scheme will be increased from 30% of cropped area in 2016-17 to 40% in 2017-18 and 50% in 2018-19. The Budget provision of Rs 5,500 crores for this Yojana in BE 2016-17 was increased to Rs 13,240 crores in RE 2016-17 to settle the arrear claims. For 2017-18, I have provided a sum of Rs 9,000 crores. The sum insured under this Yojana has more than doubled from Rs 69,000 crores in Kharif 2015 to Rs 1,41,625 crores in Kharif 2016.25. Issuance of Soil Health Cards has gathered momentum. The real benefit to farmers would be available only when the soil samples are tested quickly and nutrient level of the soil is known. Government will therefore set up new mini labs in Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and ensure 100% coverage of all 648 KVKs in the country. In addition, 1000 mini labs will be set up by qualified local entrepreneurs. Government will provide credit linked subsidy to these entrepreneurs. 26. A Long Term Irrigation Fund has already been set up in NABARD. Honourable Prime Minister has announced an addition of Rs 20,000 crores to its corpus. This will take the total corpus of this Fund to Rs 40,000 crores.27. A dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund will be set up in NABARD to achieve the goal, \\'per drop more crop\\'. The Fund will have an initial corpus of Rs 5,000 crores.28. For the post-harvest phase, we will take steps to enable farmers to get better prices for their produce in the markets. The coverage of National Agricultural Market (e-NAM) will be expanded from the current 250 markets to 585 APMCs. Assistance up to a ceiling of Rs 75 lakhs will be provided to every e-NAM market for establishment of cleaning, grading and packaging facilities. This will lead to value addition of farmers\\' produce.29. Market reforms will be undertaken and the States would be urged to denotify perishables from APMC. This will give opportunity to farmers to sell their produce and get better prices.30. We also propose to integrate farmers who grow fruits and vegetables with agro processing units for better price realisation and reduction of post-harvest losses. A model law on contract farming would therefore be prepared and circulated among the States for adoption.31. Dairy is an important source of additional income for the farmers. Availability of milk processing facility and other infrastructure will benefit the farmers through value addition. A large number of milk processing units set up under the Operation Flood Programme has since become old and obsolete. A Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund would be set up in NABARD with a corpus of Rs 8,000 crores over 3 years.Â\\xa0 Initially, the Fund will start with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crores. Â\\xa0II. RURAL POPULATION 32. I now turn to the Rural Sector, which was so dear to the heart of Mahatma Gandhi. 33. Over Rs 3 lakh crores are spent in rural areas every year, if we add up all the programmes meant for rural poor from the Central Budget, State Budgets, Bank linkage for self-help groups, etc. With a clear focus on improving accountability, outcomes and convergence, we will undertake a Mission Antyodaya to bring one crore households out of poverty and to make 50,000 gram panchayats poverty free by 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji. We will utilise the existing resources more effectively along with annual increases. This mission will work with a focused micro plan for sustainable livelihood for every deprived household. A composite index for poverty free gram panchayats would be developed to monitor the progress from the baseline. 34. Our Government has made a conscious effort to reorient MGNREGA to support our resolve to double farmers\\' income. While providing at least 100 days employment to every rural household, MGNREGA should create productive assets to improve farm productivity and incomes. The target of 5 lakh farm ponds and 10 lakh compost pits announced in the last Budget from MGNREGA funds will be fully achieved. In fact, against 5 lakh farm ponds, it is expected that about 10 lakh farm ponds would be completed by March 2017. During 2017-18, another 5 lakh farm ponds will be taken up. This single measure will contribute greatly to drought proofing of gram panchayats. 35. Participation of women in MGNREGA has increased to 55% from less than 48% in the past.36. Honourable Members would be happy to note that the budget provision of Rs 38,500 crores under MGNREGA in 2016-17 has been increased to Rs 48,000 crores in 2017-18. This is the highest ever allocation for MGNREGA. The initiative to geo-tag all MGNREGA assets and putting them in public domain has established greater transparency. We are also using space technology in a big way to plan MGNREGA works. 37. The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is now being implemented as never before. The pace of construction of PMGSY roads has accelerated to reach 133 km roads per day in 2016-17, as against an average of 73 km during the period 2011-2014. We have also taken up the task of connecting habitations with more than 100 persons in left wing extremism affected Blocks. We have committed to complete the current target under PMGSY by 2019. I have provided a sum of Rs 19,000 crores in 2017-18 for this scheme. Together with the contribution of States, an amount of Rs 27,000 crores will be spent on PMGSY in 2017-18.Also read: How Budget 2017 crossed four major hurdles to create history38. We propose to complete 1 crore houses by 2019 for the houseless and those living in kutcha houses. I have stepped up the allocation for Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - Gramin from Rs 15,000 crores in BE 2016-17 to Rs 23,000 crores in 2017-18. 39. We are well on our way to achieving 100% village electrification by 1st May 2018. An increased allocation of Rs 4,814 crores has been proposed under the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana in 2017-18. 40. I have also proposed to increase the allocations for Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihood Mission for promotion of skill development and livelihood opportunities for people in rural areas to Rs 4,500 in 2017-18. The allocation for Prime Minister\\'s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) and credit support schemes has been increased more than 3 times.41. Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) has made tremendous progress in promoting safe sanitation and ending open defecation. Sanitation coverage in rural India has gone up from 42% in October 2014 to about 60%. Open Defecation Free villages are now being given priority for piped water supply. 42. We propose to provide safe drinking water to over 28,000 arsenic and fluoride affected habitations in the next four years. This will be a sub mission of the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP). 43. For imparting new skills to the people in the rural areas, mason training will be provided to 5 lakh persons by 2022, with an immediate target of training at least 20,000 persons by 2017-18. 44.Panchayati raj institutions still lack human resources for implementing development programmes. A programme of \"human resource reforms for results\" will be launched during 2017-18 for this purpose. 45. The Government will continue to work closely with the farmers and the people in the rural areas to improve their life and environment. This is a non-negotiable agenda for our Government. The total allocation for the rural, agriculture and allied sectors in 2017-18 is Rs 1,87,223 crores, which is 24% higher than the previous year.III. YOUTH 46. Let me now focus on my proposals for the youth.47. Quality education will energise our youth. In the words of Swami Vivekananda, \"The education which does not help the common mass of people to equip themselves for the struggle for life is it worth the name?\"48. We have proposed to introduce a system of measuring annual learning outcomes in our schools. Emphasis will be given on science education and flexibility in curriculum to promote creativity through local innovative content. 49. An Innovation Fund for Secondary Education will be created to encourage local innovation for ensuring universal access, gender parity and quality improvement. This will include ICT enabled learning transformation. The focus will be on 3479 educationally backward blocks.50. In higher education, we will undertake reforms in the UGC. Good quality institutions would be enabled to have greater administrative and academic autonomy. Colleges will be identified based on accreditation and ranking, and given autonomous status. A revised framework will be put in place for outcome based accreditation and credit based programmes.51. We propose to leverage information technology and launch SWAYAM platform with at least 350 online courses. This would enable students to virtually attend the courses taught by the best faculty; access high quality reading resources; participate in discussion forums; take tests and earn academic grades. Access to SWAYAM would be widened by linkage with DTH channels, dedicated to education. 52. We propose to establish a National Testing Agency as an autonomous and self-sustained premier testing organisation to conduct all entrance examinations for higher education institutions. This would free CBSE, AICTE and other premier institutions from these administrative responsibilities so that they can focus more on academics. 53. We have a huge demographic advantage. Skill India mission was launched in July 2015 to maximise the potential of our youth. 54. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKK) have already been promoted in more than 60 districts. We now propose to extend these Kendras to more than 600 districts across the country. 100 India International Skills Centres will be established across the country. These Centres would offer advanced training and also courses in foreign languages.This will help those of our youth who seek job opportunities outside the country.55. In 2017-18, we also propose to launch the Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion programme (SANKALP) at a cost of Rs 4,000 crores. SANKALP will provide market relevant training to 3.5 crore youth.56. The next phase of Skill Strengthening for Industrial Value Enhancement (STRIVE) will also be launched in 2017-18 at a cost of Rs 2,200 crores. STRIVE will focus on improving the quality and market relevance of vocational training provided in ITIs and strengthen the apprenticeship programmes through industry cluster approach.57. A special scheme for creating employment in the textile sector has already been launched. A similar scheme will be implemented for the leather and footwear industries.58. Tourism is a big employment generator and has a multiplier impact on the economy. Five Special Tourism Zones, anchored on SPVs, will be set up in partnership with the States. Incredible India 2.0 Campaign will be launched across the world. IV. THE POOR AND THE UNDERPRIVILEGED59. Madam Speaker, I now turn to my proposals for the poor and the underprivileged. 60.Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas begins with the girl child and women. Mahila Shakti Kendra will be set up at village level with an allocation of Rs 500 crores in 14 lakh ICDS Anganwadi Centres. This will provide one stop convergent support services for empowering rural women with opportunities for skill development, employment, digital literacy, health and nutrition. A nationwide scheme for financial assistance to pregnant women has already been announced by Honourable Prime Minister on 31st December, 2016. Under this scheme, Rs 6,000 each will be transferred directly to the bank accounts of pregnant women who undergo institutional delivery and vaccinate their children.61. For the welfare of Women and Children under various schemes across all Ministries, I have stepped up the allocation from Rs 1,56,528 crores in BE 2016-17 to Rs 1,84,632 crores in 2017-18.62. We propose to facilitate higher investment in affordable housing. Affordable housing will now be given infrastructure status, which will enable these projects to avail the associated benefits. 63. The National Housing Bank will refinance individual housing loans of about Rs 20,000 crore in 2017-18. Thanks to the surplus liquidity created by demonetisation, the Banks have already started reducing their lending rates, including those for housing.Â\\xa0 In addition, interest subvention for housing loans has also been announced by the Honourable Prime Minister.64. Poverty is usually associated with poor health. It is the poor who suffer the maximum from various chronic diseases. Government has therefore prepared an action plan to eliminate Kala-Azar and Filariasis by 2017, Leprosy by 2018 and Measles by 2020. Elimination of tuberculosis by 2025 is also targeted. Similarly,action plan has been prepared to reduce IMR from 39 in 2014 to 28 by 2019 and MMR from 167 in 2011-13 to 100 by 2018-2020. 1.5 lakh Health Sub Centres will be transformed into Health and Wellness Centres.65. We need to ensure adequate availability of specialist doctors to strengthen Secondary and Tertiary levels of health care. We have therefore decided to take steps to create additional 5,000 Post Graduate seats per annum. In addition, steps will be taken to roll out DNB courses in big District Hospitals; strengthen PG teaching in select ESI and Municipal Corporation Hospitals; and encourage reputed Private Hospitals to start DNB courses. We will work with the State Governments to take these tasks forward. The Government is committed to take necessary steps for structural transformation of the Regulatory framework of Medical Education and Practice in India.Also read: Railways in Union Budget 2017: Cheaper e-tickets, bio-toilets in all coaches; what else Jaitley said66. Two new All India Institutes of Medical Sciences will be set up in the States of Jharkhand and Gujarat.67. We propose to amend the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules to ensure availability of drugs at reasonable prices and promote use of generic medicines. New rules for regulating medical devices will also be formulated.Â\\xa0 These rules will be internationally harmonised and attract investment into this sector.Â\\xa0 This will reduce the cost of such devices. 68. We are keen on fostering a conducive labour environment wherein labour rights are protected and harmonious labour relations lead to higher productivity. Legislative reforms will be undertaken to simplify, rationalise and amalgamate the existing labour laws into 4 Codes on (i) wages; (ii) industrial relations; (iii) social security and welfare; and (iv) safety and working conditions.Â\\xa0 The Model Shops and Establishment Bill 2016 has been circulated to all States for consideration and adoption.Â\\xa0 This would open up additional avenues for employment of women. The amendment made to the Payment of Wages Act, is another initiative of our Government for the benefit of the labour and ease of doing business. Â\\xa069. Our Government is giving special importance to implementation of the schemes for welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Minorities.Â\\xa0 The allocation for the welfare of Scheduled Castes has been stepped up from `38,833 crores in BE 2016-17 to ` 52,393 crores in2017-18, representing an increase of about 35%. The allocation for Scheduled Tribes has been increased to `31,920 crores and for Minority Affairs to `4,195 crores. The Government will introduce outcome based monitoring of expenditure in these sectors by the NITI Aayog. Â\\xa070. For senior citizens, Aadhar based Smart Cards containing their health details will be introduced.Â\\xa0 A beginning will be made through a pilot in 15 districts during 2017-18.Â\\xa0 The LIC will implement a scheme for senior citizens to provide assured pension, with a guaranteed return of 8% per annum for 10 years. V.INFRASTRUCTURE71. The fifth component of TEC India agenda is Infrastructure. Â\\xa072. Railways, roads and rivers are the lifeline of our country.Â\\xa0 I feel privileged to present the first combined Budget of independent India that includes the Railways also.Â\\xa0 We are now in a position to synergise the investments in railways, roads, waterways and civil aviation. For 2017-18, the total capital and development expenditure of Railways has been pegged at ` 1,31,000 crores.Â\\xa0 This includes ` 55,000 crores provided by the Government.Â\\xa0 Â\\xa073.Â\\xa0 Among other things, the Railways will focus on four major areas, namely :(i) Passenger safety; (ii) Capital and development works;(iii) Cleanliness; and(iv)Finance and accounting reforms.74. For passenger safety, a Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh will be created with a corpus ofÂ\\xa0 Rs 1 lakh crores over a period of 5 years.Â\\xa0 Besides seed capital from the Government, the Railways will arrange the balance resources from their own revenues and other sources.Â\\xa0 Government will lay down clear cut guidelines and timeline for implementing various safety works to be funded from this Kosh. Unmanned level crossings on Broad Gauge lines will be eliminated by 2020.Â\\xa0 Expert international assistance will be harnessed to improve safety preparedness and maintenance practices.75.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 In the next 3 years, the throughput is proposed to be enhanced by 10%.Â\\xa0 This will be done through modernisation and upgradation of identified corridors.Â\\xa0 Railway lines of 3,500 kms will be commissioned in 2017-18, as against 2,800 kms in 2016-17. Steps will be taken to launch dedicated trains for tourism and pilgrimage. Â\\xa076. Railways have set up joint ventures with 9 State Governments. 70 projects have been identified for construction and development. 77. A beginning has been made with regard to station redevelopment. At least 25 stations are expected to be awarded during 2017-18 for station redevelopment.Â\\xa0 500 stations will be made differently abled friendly by providing lifts and escalators. Â\\xa078.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 It is proposed to feed about 7,000 stations with solar power in the medium term.Â\\xa0 A beginning has already been made in 300 stations.Â\\xa0 Works will be taken up for 2,000 railway stations as part of 1000 MW solar mission. Â\\xa079. Our focus is on swachh rail.Â\\xa0 SMS based Clean My Coach Service has been started.Â\\xa0 It is now proposed to introduce \\'Coach Mitra\\' facility, a single window interface, to register all coach related complaints and requirements.Â\\xa0 By 2019, all coaches of Indian Railways will be fitted with bio toilets.Â\\xa0 Pilot plants for environment friendly disposal of solid waste and conversion of biodegradable waste to energy are being set up at New Delhi and Jaipur railway stations.Â\\xa0 Five more such solid waste management plants are now being taken up.80. Today Indian Railways face stiff competition from other modes of transportation which are dominated by the private sector.Â\\xa0 Transformative measures have to be undertaken to make Indian Railways competitive to retain their position of pre-eminence. The following steps will therefore be taken :(i) Railways will implement end to end integrated transport solutions for select commodities through partnership with logistics players, who would provide both front and back end connectivity.Â\\xa0 Rolling stocks and practices will be customised to transport perishable goods, especially agricultural products.(ii)Â\\xa0 Railways will offer competitive ticket booking facility to the public at large. Service charge on e-tickets booked through IRCTC has been withdrawn. Cashless reservations have gone up from 58% to 68%.(iii) As part of accounting reforms, accrual based financial statements will be rolled out by March 2019. Â\\xa081. It will be our continuous endeavour to improve the Operating Ratio of the Railways.Â\\xa0 The tariffs of Railways would be fixed, taking into consideration costs, quality of service, social obligations and competition from other forms of transport. 82. Metro rail is emerging as an important mode of urban transportation.Â\\xa0 A new Metro Rail Policy will be announced with focus on innovative models of implementation and financing, as well as standardisation and indigenisation of hardware and software.Â\\xa0 This will open up new job opportunities for our youth. 83.Â\\xa0 A new Metro Rail Act will be enacted by rationalising the existing laws. This will facilitate greater private participation and investment in construction and operation. Also read: Budget 2017 has something for everyone: All you need to know84. In the road sector, I have stepped up the Budget allocation for highways from ` 57,976 crores in BE 2016-17 to ` 64,900 crores in 2017-18.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 2,000 kms of coastal connectivity roads have been identified for construction and development. This will facilitate better connectivity with ports and remote villages.Â\\xa0 The total length of roads, including those under PMGSY, built from 2014-15 till the current year is about 1,40,000 kms which is significantly higher than previous three years.85. An effective multi modal logistics and transport sector will make our economy more competitive.Â\\xa0 A specific programme for development of multi-modal logistics parks, together with multi modal transport facilities, will be drawn up and implemented. 86. Select airports in Tier 2 cities will be taken up for operation and maintenance in the PPP mode.Â\\xa0 Airport Authority of India Act will be amended to enable effective monetisation of land assets.Â\\xa0 The resources, so raised, will be utilised for airport upgradation.87. For transportation sector as a whole, including rail, roads, shipping, I have provided ` 2,41,387Â\\xa0 crores in 2017-18.Â\\xa0 This magnitude of investment will spur a huge amount of economic activity across the country and create more job opportunities.88.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Telecom sector is an important component of our infrastructure eco system.Â\\xa0 The recent spectrum auctions have removed spectrum scarcity in the country.Â\\xa0 This will give a major fillip to mobile broadband and Digital India for the benefit of people living in rural and remote areas. 89. Under the BharatNet Project, OFC has been laid in 1,55,000 kms.Â\\xa0 I have stepped up the allocation for BharatNet Project to ` 10,000 crores in 2017-18.Â\\xa0 By the end of 2017-18, high speed broadband connectivity on optical fibre will be available in more than 1,50,000 gram panchayats,Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 with wifi hot spots and access to digital services at low tariffs. A DigiGaon initiative will be launched to provide tele-medicine, education and skills through digital technology. Â\\xa090. For strengthening our Energy sector, Government has decided to set up Strategic Crude Oil Reserves.Â\\xa0 In the first phase, 3 such Reserves facilities have been set up.Â\\xa0 Now in the second phase, it is proposed to set up caverns at 2 more locations, namely, Chandikhole in Odisha and Bikaner in Rajasthan.Â\\xa0 This will take our strategic reserve capacity to 15.33 MMT.91. In solar energy, we now propose to take up the second phase of Solar Park development for additional 20,000 MW capacity. 92. We are also creating an eco-system to make India a global hub for electronics manufacturing.Â\\xa0 Over 250 investment proposals for electronics manufacturing have been received in the last 2 years, totalling an investment of ` 1.26 lakh crores.Â\\xa0 A number of global leaders and mobile manufacturers have set up production facilities in India.Â\\xa0 I have therefore exponentially increased the allocation for incentive schemes like M-SIPS and EDF to Rs 745 crores in 2017-18.Â\\xa0 This is an all-time high.93.Â\\xa0 We have to focus on our export infrastructure in a competitive world.Â\\xa0 A new and restructured Central scheme, namely, Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) will be launched in 2017-18. 94. The total allocation for infrastructure development in 2017-18 stands at `3,96,135 crores.VI.Â\\xa0 FINANCIAL SECTOR 95. I now turn to the Financial Sector.Â\\xa0 The focus of TEC India agenda in this sector is on building stable and stronger institutions.Â\\xa0 We will continue with our reform agenda with several new measures. Â\\xa096. Our Government has already undertaken substantive reforms in FDI policy in the last two years.Â\\xa0 More than 90% of the total FDI inflows are now through the automatic route.Â\\xa0 The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has successfully implemented e-filing and online processing of FDI applications.Â\\xa0 We have now reached a stage where FIPB can be phased out.Â\\xa0 We have therefore decided to abolish the FIPB in 2017-18.Â\\xa0 A roadmap for the same will be announced in the next few months.Â\\xa0 In the meantime, further liberalisation of FDI policy is under consideration and necessary announcements will be made in due course.97. The Commodities markets require further reforms for the benefits of farmers.Â\\xa0 An expert committee will be constituted to study and promote creation of an operational and legal framework to integrate spot market and derivatives market for commodities trading.Â\\xa0 e-NAM would be an integral part of such framework. Â\\xa098. The draft bill to curtail the menace of illicit deposit schemes has been placed in the public domain and will be introduced shortly after its finalisation.Â\\xa0 There is an urgent need to protect the poor and gullible investors from another set of dubious schemes, operated by unscrupulous entities who exploit the regulatory gaps in the Multi State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002.Â\\xa0 We will amend this Act in consultation with various stakeholders, as part of our \\'Clean India\\' agenda.99. The bill relating to resolution of financial firms will be introduced in the current Budget Session of Parliament.Â\\xa0 This will contribute to stability and resilience of our financial system.Â\\xa0 It will also protect the consumers of various financial institutions.Â\\xa0 Together with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, a resolution mechanism for financial firms will ensure comprehensiveness of the resolution system in our country.100. I had stated in my last Budget speech that a Bill will be introduced to streamline institutional arrangements for resolution of disputes in infrastructure related construction contracts, PPP and public utility contracts.Â\\xa0 After extensive stakeholders\\' consultations, we have decided that the required mechanism would be instituted as part of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996.Â\\xa0 An amendment Bill will be introduced in this regard.Also read: Mamata Banerjee tears into Arun Jaitley\\'s budget, call it clueless, useless101. Cyber security is critical for safeguarding the integrity and stability of our financial sector.Â\\xa0 A Computer Emergency Response Team for our Financial Sector (CERT-Fin) will be established.Â\\xa0 This entity will work in close coordination with all financial sector regulators and other stakeholders.102. I have also proposed several other measures in the financial sector which are listed in Annex I.103. Listing of Public Sector enterprises will foster greater public accountability and unlock the true value of these companies.Â\\xa0 The Government will put in place a revised mechanism and procedure to ensure time bound listing of identified CPSEs on stock exchanges. The disinvestment policy announced by me in the last budget will continue.104. The shares of Railway PSEs like IRCTC, IRFC and IRCON will be listed in stock exchanges.105. We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions.Â\\xa0 By these methods, the CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry.Â\\xa0 It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. Possibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector.Â\\xa0 We propose to create an integrated public sector \\'oil major\\' which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies.106. Our ETF, comprising shares of ten CPSEs, has received overwhelming response in the recent Further Fund Offering (FFO).Â\\xa0 We will continue to use ETF as a vehicle for further disinvestment of shares.Â\\xa0 Accordingly, a new ETF with diversified CPSE stocks and other Government holdings will be launched in 2017-18.107. The focus on resolution of stressed legacy accounts of Banks continues.Â\\xa0 The legal framework has been strengthened to facilitate resolution, through the enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the amendments to the SARFAESI and Debt Recovery Tribunal Acts.Â\\xa0 In line with the \\'Indradhanush\\' roadmap, I have provided Rs 10,000 crores for recapitalisation of Banks in 2017-18.Â\\xa0 Additional allocation will be provided, as may be required.108. Listing and trading of Security Receipts issued by a securitization company or a reconstruction company under the SARFAESI Act will be permitted in SEBI registered stock exchanges. This will enhance capital flows into the securitization industry and will particularly be helpful to deal with bank NPAs.109. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana has contributed significantly to funding the unfunded and the underfunded.Â\\xa0 Last year, the target of ` 1.22 lakh crores was exceeded.Â\\xa0 For 2017-18, I propose to double the lending target of 2015-16 and set it at ` 2.44 lakh crores.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Priority will be given to Dalits, Tribals, Backward Classes, Minorities and Women. 110. The Stand Up India scheme was launched by our Government in April 2016 to support Dalit, Tribal and Women entrepreneurs to set up greenfield enterprises and become job creators.Â\\xa0 Over 16,000 new enterprises have come up through this scheme in activities, as diverse as food processing, garments, diagnostic centres, etc.VII.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 DIGITAL ECONOMY111. Promotion of a digital economy is an integral part of Government\\'s strategy to clean the system and weed out corruption and black money.Â\\xa0 It has a transformative impact in terms of greater formalisation of the economy and mainstreaming of financial savings into the banking system.Â\\xa0 This, in turn, is expected to energise private investment in the country through lower cost of credit.Â\\xa0 India is now on the cusp of a massive digital revolution. Â\\xa0112.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 A shift to digital payments has huge benefits for the common man.Â\\xa0 The earlier initiative of our Government to promote financial inclusion and the JAM trinity were important precursors to our current push for digital transactions.113.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Already there is evidence of increased digital transactions.Â\\xa0 The BHIM app has been launched. It will unleash the power of mobile phones for digital payments and financial inclusion.Â\\xa0 125 lakh people have adopted the BHIM app so far. The Government will launch two new schemes to promote the usage of BHIM; these are, Referral Bonus Scheme for individuals and a Cashback Scheme for merchants. Â\\xa0114.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Aadhar Pay, a merchant version of Aadhar Enabled Payment System, will be launched shortly.Â\\xa0 This will be specifically beneficial for those who do not have debit cards, mobile wallets and mobile phones.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 A Mission will be set up with a target of 2,500 crore digital transactions for 2017-18 through UPI, USSD, Aadhar Pay, IMPS and debit cards. Banks have targeted to introduce additional 10 lakh new PoS terminals by March 2017.Â\\xa0 They will be encouraged to introduce 20 lakh Aadhar based PoS by September 2017.Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0115.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Increased digital transactions will enable small and micro enterprises to access formal credit.Â\\xa0 Government will encourage SIDBI to refinance credit institutions which provide unsecured loans, at reasonable interest rates, to borrowers based on their transaction history.116.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 The digital payment infrastructure and grievance handling mechanisms shall be strengthened.Â\\xa0 The focus would be on rural and semi urban areas through Post Offices, Fair Price Shops and Banking Correspondents.Â\\xa0 Steps would be taken to promote and possibly mandate petrol pumps, fertilizer depots, municipalities, Block offices, road transport offices, universities, colleges, hospitals and other institutions to have facilities for digital payments, including BHIM App.Â\\xa0 A proposal to mandate all Government receipts through digital means, beyond a prescribed limit, is under consideration. Â\\xa0117. Government will strengthen the Financial Inclusion Fund to augment resources for taking up these initiatives.118. Government will consider and work with various stakeholders for early implementation of the interim recommendations of the Committee of Chief Ministers on digital transactions. Â\\xa0119. The Committee on Digital Payments constituted by Department of Economic Affairs has recommended structural reforms in the payment eco system, including amendments to the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.Â\\xa0 Government will undertake a comprehensive review of this Act and bring about appropriate amendments.Â\\xa0 To begin with, it is proposed to create a Payments Regulatory Board in the Reserve Bank of India by replacing the existing Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems.Â\\xa0 Necessary amendments are proposed to this effect in the Finance Bill 2017. 120.Â\\xa0 As we move faster on the path of digital transactions and cheque payments, we need to ensure that the payees of dishonoured cheques are able to realise the payments. Government is therefore considering the option of amending the Negotiable Instruments Act suitably.Also read: Union Budget 2017: Rahul Gandhi calls it a damp squib, says it lacks visionVIII.Â\\xa0 PUBLIC SERVICE121. I now turn to Public Service.Â\\xa0 Our focus here is on effective government and efficient service delivery. 122. We have made a strong beginning with regard to Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to LPG and kerosene consumers.Â\\xa0 Chandigarh and eight districts of Haryana have become kerosene free.Â\\xa0 84 Government schemes have also boarded on the DBT platform. Â\\xa0123. The Government e-market place which is now functional for procurement of goods and services, has been selected as one of the winners of the South Asia Procurement Innovation Awards of the World Bank.124. Our citizens in far flung regions of the country find it difficult to obtain passports and redress passport related grievances.Â\\xa0 We have decided to utilise the Head Post Offices as front offices for rendering passport services. 125. Our defence forces keep the country safe from both external and internal threats.Â\\xa0 A Centralised Defence Travel System has now been developed through which travel tickets can be booked online by our soldiers and officers.Â\\xa0 They do not have to face the hassle of standing in queues with railway warrants.126. A comprehensive web based interactive Pension Disbursement System for Defence Pensioners will be established.Â\\xa0 This system will receive pension proposals and make payments centrally.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 This will reduce the grievances of defence pensioners.127. At present our citizens, especially those belonging to the poor and unprivileged sections, go through cumbersome procedures of Government recruitment.Â\\xa0 There are multiplicity of agencies and examinations.Â\\xa0 We propose to introduce a system of single registration and two tier system of examination. 128. Over the years, the number of tribunals have multiplied with overlapping functions.Â\\xa0 We propose to rationalise the number of tribunals and merge tribunals wherever appropriate.129. In the recent past, there have been instances of big time offenders, including economic offenders, fleeing the country to escape the reach of law. We have to ensure that the law is allowed to take its own course. Government is therefore considering introduction of legislative changes, or even a new law, to confiscate the assets of such persons located within the country, till they submit to the jurisdiction of the appropriate legal forum. Needless to say that all necessary constitutional safeguards will be followed in such cases.130. Our Government will continue to remain committed to improve the standards of public service and transparent governance.Â\\xa0 Service to the people was the life-long commitment of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi.Â\\xa0 As we approach, the 150th Birth Anniversary of the Mahatma, we will take all steps to celebrate it in a befitting manner.Â\\xa0 A High Level Committee under the Chairmanship of Honourable Prime Minister is proposed to be set up for the same. We will also commemorate the centenary year of Champaran Satyagrah this year. Government of India will support Government of Gujarat to commemorate 100 years of Sabarmati Ashram in 2017, in a befitting manner. 200 years ago in 1817, a valiant uprising of soldiers led by Buxi Jagabandhu took place in KhordhaÂ\\xa0 of Odisha.Â\\xa0 We will commemorate the same appropriately.Also read: Budget 2017: 10 things to expect from Finance Minister Arun JaitleyIX.Â\\xa0 PRUDENT FISCAL MANAGEMENT131. I now turn to the fiscal situation in the context of the Budget for 2017-18. Â\\xa0132. The total expenditure in Budget for 2017-18 has been placed at Rs 21.47 lakh crores. With the abolition of Plan-Non Plan classification of expenditure, the focus is now on Revenue and Capital expenditure.Â\\xa0 I have stepped up the allocation for Capital expenditure by 25.4% over the previous year. This will have multiplier effects and lead to higher growth.Â\\xa0 The total resources being transferred to the States and the Union Territories with Legislatures is Rs 4.11 lakh crores, against ` 3.60 lakh crores in BE 2016-17. Details of allocations for important sectors and schemes and transfer of resources to States are given in Annex II of my Speech.133. I have made a provision of ` 3,000 crores under the Department of Economic Affairs to implement various Budget announcements and other new schemes in 2017-18.Â\\xa0 For Defence expenditure excluding pensions, I have provided a sum of ` 2,74,114 crores including ` 86,488Â\\xa0 crores for Defence capital. I have increased the allocation for Scientific Ministries to` 37,435 crore in 2017-18.134. For the first time, a consolidated Outcome Budget, covering all Ministries and Departments, is being laid along with the other Budget documents. This will improve accountability of Government expenditure.135. The FRBM Review Committee has given its report recently.Â\\xa0 The Committee has done an elaborate exercise and has recommended that a sustainable debt path must be the principal macro-economic anchor of our fiscal policy.Â\\xa0 The Committee has favoured Debt to GDP of 60% for the General Government by 2023, consisting of 40% for Central Government and 20% for State Governments.Â\\xa0 Within this framework, the Committee has derived and recommended 3% fiscal deficit for the next three years.Â\\xa0 The Committee has also provided for \\'Escape Clauses\\', for deviations upto 0.5% of GDP, from the stipulated fiscal deficit target.Â\\xa0 Among the triggers for taking recourse to these Escape Clauses, the Committee has included \"far-reaching structural reforms in the economy with unanticipated fiscal implications\" as one of the factors.Â\\xa0 Although there is a strong case now to invoke this Escape Clause, I am refraining from doing so.Â\\xa0 The Report of the Committee will be carefully examined and appropriate decisions taken in due course. Â\\xa0136. Nevertheless, I take note of the fiscal deficit roadmap of 3% recommended by the Committee for the next three years.Â\\xa0 I have taken into consideration the need for higher public expenditure in the context of sluggish private sector investment and slow global growth.Â\\xa0 I have kept in mind the recommendation of the Committee that a sustainable debt should be the underlying basis of prudent fiscal management.Â\\xa0 Considering all these aspects, I have pegged the fiscal deficit for 2017-18 at 3.2% of GDP and remain committed to achieve 3% in the following year.Â\\xa0 With this gradual approach, I have ensured adherence to fiscal consolidation, without compromising the requirements of public investment. 137. I have taken due care to limit the net market borrowing of Government to ` 3.48 lakh crores after buyback, much lower than ` 4.25 lakh crores of the previous year.Â\\xa0 More importantly, the Revenue Deficit of 2.3% in BE 2016-17 stands reduced to 2.1% in the Revised Estimates.Â\\xa0 The Revenue Deficit for next year is pegged at 1.9% , against 2% mandated by the FRBM Act.138. It will be our endeavour to improve upon these fiscal numbers, especially the fiscal deficit, in the next year, through greater focus on quality of expenditure and higher tax realisation from the huge cash deposits in Banks, triggered by demonetisation. Â\\xa0PARTÂ\\xa0 BMadam Speaker,139. I shall now present my tax proposals:140. India\\'s tax to GDP ratio is very low, and the proportion of direct tax to indirect tax is not optimal from the view point of social justice. I place before you certain data to indicate that our direct tax collection is not commensurate with the income and consumption pattern of Indian economy.Â\\xa0 As against estimated 4.2 crore persons engaged in organised sector employment, the number of individuals filing return for salary income are only 1.74 crore.Â\\xa0 As against 5.6 crore informal sector individual enterprises and firms doing small business in India, the number of returns filed by this category are only 1.81 crore.Â\\xa0 Out of the 13.94 lakh companies registered in India upto 31st March, 2014, 5.97 lakh companies have filed their returns for Assessment Year 2016-17. Of the 5.97 lakh companies which have filed their returns for Assessment Year 2016-17 so far, as many as 2.76 lakh companies have shown losses or zero income.Â\\xa0 2.85 lakh companies have shown profit before tax of less than Rs1 crore.Â\\xa0 28,667 companies have shown profit between Rs 1 crore to Rs 10 crore, and only 7781 companies have profit before tax of more than Rs10 crores.141. Among the 3.7 crore individuals who filed the tax returns in 2015-16, 99 lakh show income below the exemption limit ofÂ\\xa0 Rs 2.5 lakh p.a., 1.95 crore show income between Rs 2.5 to Rs 5 lakh, 52 lakh show income between Rs 5 to Rs 10 lakhs and only 24 lakh people show income above Rs 10 lakhs.Â\\xa0 Of the 76 lakh individual assesses who declare income above Rs 5 lakh, 56 lakh are in the salaried class. The number of people showing income more than Rs 50 lakh in the entire country is only 1.72 lakh.Â\\xa0 We can contrast this with the fact that in the last five years, more than 1.25 crore cars have been sold, and number of Indian citizens who flew abroad, either for business or tourism, is 2 crore in the year 2015.Â\\xa0 From all these figures we can conclude that we are largely a tax non-compliant society.Â\\xa0 The predominance of cash in the economy makes it possible for the people to evade their taxes.Â\\xa0 When too many people evade taxes, the burden of their share falls on those who are honest and compliant.142. After the demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received in respect of deposits made by people in old currency presents a revealing picture.Â\\xa0 During the period 8th November to 30th December 2016, deposits between Rs2 lakh and Rs 80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of Rs 5.03 lakh.Â\\xa0 Deposits of more than 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of ` 3.31 crores.Â\\xa0 This data mining will help us immensely in expanding the tax net as well as increasing the revenues, which was one of the objectives of demonetisation. 143. Madam Speaker, one of the main priorities of our Government is to eliminate the black money component from the economy.Â\\xa0 We are committed to make our taxation rates more reasonable, our tax administration more fair and expand the tax base in the country.Â\\xa0 This approach will change the colour of money. 144. The net tax revenue of 2013-14 was Rs 11.38 lakh crores.Â\\xa0 This grew by 9.4% in 2014-15 and 17% in 2015-16.Â\\xa0 As per the RE of 2016-17, we will end the year with a high growth rate of 17% for the second year in a row.Â\\xa0 Because of the serious efforts made by the Government, the rate of growth of advance tax in personal income tax in the first three quarters of the current financial is 34.8%. 145. Madam Speaker, the thrust of my tax proposals in this Budget is stimulating growth, relief to middle class, affordable housing, curbing black money, promoting digital economy, transparency of political funding and simplification of tax administration.Measures for Promoting Affordable Housing and Real Estate Sector 146. In my budget proposals last year, I had announced a scheme for profit-linked income tax exemption for promoters of affordable housing scheme which has received a very good response.Â\\xa0 However, in order to make this scheme more attractive, I propose certain changes in the scheme.Â\\xa0 First of all, instead of built up area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr., the carpet area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr. will be counted.Â\\xa0 Also the 30 sq.mtr. limit will apply only in case of municipal limits of 4 metropolitan cities while for the rest of the country including in the peripheral areas of metros, limit of 60 sq.mtr. will apply.Â\\xa0 In order to be eligible, the scheme was to be completed in 3 years after commencement.Â\\xa0 I propose to extend this period to 5 years. 147. At present, the houses which are unoccupied after getting completion certificates are subjected to tax on notional rental income.Â\\xa0 For builders for whom constructed buildings are stock-in-trade, I propose to apply this rule only after one year of the end of the year in which completion certificate is received so that they get some breathing time for liquidating their inventory.148. We also propose to make a number of changes in the capital gain taxation provisions in respect of land and building. The holding period for considering gain from immovable property to be long term is 3 years now.Â\\xa0 This is proposed to be reduced to 2 years.Â\\xa0 Also, the base year for indexation is proposed to be shifted from 1.4.1981 to 1.4.2001 for all classes of assets including immovable property.Â\\xa0 This move will significantly reduce the capital gain tax liability while encouraging the mobility of assets. We also plan to extend the basket of financial instruments in which the capital gains can be invested without payment of tax. 149. For Joint Development Agreement signed for development of property, the liability to pay capital gain tax will arise in the year the project is completed. 150. The new capital for State of Andhra Pradesh is being constructed by innovative land-pooling mechanism without use of the Land Acquisition Act. I propose to exempt from capital gain tax, persons holding land on 2.6.2014, the date on which the State of Andhra Pradesh was reorganised, and whose land is being pooled for creation of capital city under the Government scheme. Measures for Stimulating Growth Also read: Union Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley announces Rs 2,74,114 crore for defence151.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 A concessional with-holding rate of 5% is being charged on interest earned by foreign entities in external commercial borrowings or in bonds and Government securities.Â\\xa0 This concession is available till 30.6.2017.Â\\xa0 I propose to extend it to 30.6.2020.Â\\xa0 This benefit is also extended to Rupee Denominated (Masala) Bonds. 152. The Government gave income tax exemptions to start-ups with certain conditions last year. For the purpose of carry forward of losses in respect of such start-ups, the condition of continuous holding of 51% of voting rights has been relaxed subject to the condition that the holding of the original promoter/promoters continues.Â\\xa0 Also the profit linked deduction available to the start-ups for 3 years out of 5 years is being changed to 3 years out of 7 years.153.Â\\xa0 Minimum Alternate Tax is at present levied as an advance tax.Â\\xa0 There is a strong demand for abolition of MAT.Â\\xa0 Although the plan for phasing out of exemptions will kick in from 1.4.2017, the full benefit of revenue out of phase-out will be available to Government only after 7 to 10 years when all those who are already availing exemptions at present complete their period of availment.Â\\xa0 Therefore, it is not practical to remove or reduce MAT at present.Â\\xa0 However, in order to allow companies to use MAT credit in future years, I propose to allow carry forward of MAT upto a period of 15 years instead of 10 years at present. 154.Â\\xa0 In my Budget proposals in 2015, I had announced that I would be bringing the corporate income tax rate down to 25% gradually.Â\\xa0 In 2016 Budget, I had announced a reduction by 1% in case of those companies whose turnover is less than Rs 5 crore.Â\\xa0 In the same Budget, I had also announced that new manufacturing companies who do not avail of any exemption would be charged only 25% income tax. 155. Medium and Small Enterprises occupy bulk of economic activities and are also instrumental in providing maximum employment to people.Â\\xa0 However, since they do not get many exemptions, they end up paying more taxes as compared to large companies.Â\\xa0 As per data of financial year 2015-16, 2.85 lakh companies making profit of less than Rs 1 crore pay effective tax rate of 30.26% while 298 companies making profit above Rs 500 crores pay effective tax rate of 25.90%.156.Â\\xa0 In order to make MSME companies more viable and also to encourage firms to migrate to company format, I propose to reduce the income tax for smaller companies with annual turnover upto Rs 50 crore to 25%.Â\\xa0 As per data of Assessment Year 2015-16, there are 6.94 lakh companies filing returns of which 6.67 lakh companies fall in this category and, therefore, percentage-wise 96% of companies will get this benefit of lower taxation. This will make our MSME sector more competitive as compared to large companies.Â\\xa0 The revenue forgone estimate for this measure is expected to be Rs 7,200 crore per annum.157. In order to give a boost to banking sector, I propose to increase allowable provision for Non-Performing Asset from 7.5% to 8.5%.Â\\xa0 This will reduce the tax liability of banks.Â\\xa0 I also propose to tax interest receivable on actual receipt instead of accrual basis in respect of NPA accounts of all non-scheduled cooperative banks also at par with scheduled banks. This will remove hardship of having to pay tax even when interest income is not realised.158.Â\\xa0 Considering the wide range of use of LNG as fuel as well as feed stock for petro-chemicals sector, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on LNG from 5% to 2.5%.159. In order to incentivise domestic value addition and to promote Make in India, I propose to make changes in Customs & Central Excise duties in respect of certain items which are given in the Annex III of this speech.Â\\xa0 Some of these proposals are also for addressing duty inversion.Promoting Digital Economy 160.Â\\xa0 There is a scheme of presumptive income tax for small and medium tax payers whose turnover is upto Rs 2 crores.Â\\xa0 At present, 8% of their turnover is counted as presumptive income.Â\\xa0 I propose to make this 6% in respect of turnover which is received by non-cash means. This benefit will be applicable for transactions undertaken in the current year also.161. I propose to limit the cash expenditure allowable as deduction, both for revenue as well as capital expenditure, to Rs 10,000.Â\\xa0 Similarly, the limit of cash donation which can be received by a charitable trust is being reduced from Rs 10,000/- to ` 2000/-.162. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up by the Government for black money has suggested that no transaction above Rs 3 lakh should be permitted in cash.Â\\xa0 The Government has decided to accept this proposal.Â\\xa0 Suitable amendment to the Income-tax Act is proposed in the Finance Bill for enforcing this decision.163. To promote cashless transactions, I propose to exempt BCD, Excise/CV duty', 'Air India has asked Delhi Police to explain the delay in action against controversial Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad who is accused of thrashing an elderly airline employee.The national carrier informed the police that no action against the parliamentarian was impacting the morale of its staff, nearly a month after the alleged incident. ?Any delay in taking action will give a wrong impression.

This will also help promote BEST buses,? said a BEST official.The museum at the Anik is more than 20 years old, and houses old bus tickets, models of the electric tram, ticket dispensing machines and historical photographs showing of BEST buses over the years.

Airoli and Vikhroli wetlands ? among 12 unique mangrove forests in the country.Mangrove forests grow in creeks, estuaries, bays and lagoons and in inter-tidal areas ? area between the high tide and the low tide. Their ecosystem is believed to have evolved around 114 million years back in tropical and subtropical regions and India  has 3% (4,740 sq km) of the world?s mangrove cover. The unique mangroves located along India?s 7,516-km coastline are in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The world?s largest mangrove forests in Sunderbans, West Bengal, are also featured in the list. The list was released by the MSI and the Goa state biodiversity board  at the National Mangrove Conference in Dona Paula, Goa last week. Maharashtra is the only state to have a dedicated cell protecting its mangrove cover.?Mangroves are under threat from developmental projects and we are failing to understand the value of safeguarding the coastline from disasters and their economic value when it comes to tourism. We do not have the concept of preservation in India,? said Arvind Untawale, secretary, MSI. ?The idea behind selecting these 12 locations is to enhance conservation and protection of different mangrove species, the biodiversity and establish them as international tourism destinations.?He added that tigers in Sunderbans, saltwater crocodiles in Odisha, and birds, fish, crabs, and the unique flora present in this ecosystem are not getting enough attention from the Centre. ?There is great potential for adventure, research, information, conservation and management aspects, which the tourism sector needs to focus upon,? said Untawale.Mangroves in?Vikhroli. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(HT File)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t?What most people are unaware of is that India is home to a maximum number of flora and fauna species in the world,? said Dr K Kathiresan, former dean and director, Annamalai University and from the Centre of Advanced Study in Marine Biology. He added that of the total 4,060 species living in India?s mangroves, 969 are floral species, accounting for 24% of the biodiversity and the rest 3,091 are faunal species. ?Mangrove forests can sequester carbon 10 times more than tropical forests and carbon storage is four times more than tropical, temperate or boreal forests (coniferous forests),? said Dr Kathiresan.Experts said the tourism potential of mangroves in India, unlike many other countries in the world, is underexplored. ?We have to develop such spots for people to realise its importance. Tourism spots will not only help boost revenue but even their protection,? said N Vasudevan, additional principal chief conservator of forest, Maharashtra state mangrove cell.

Â\\xa0Also read | Sasikala set to take charge as Tamil Nadu CM? Decision likely in crucial AIADMK meet tomorrowHere\\'s the full text of Gautami\\'s letter:I have written an open and very direct letter to our Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji, regarding my questions on the tragic demise of Amma, our Honourable Chief Minister Dr. J Jayalalithaa. This letter was published on the 8th of December 2016 through my blog and directly sent to his Twitter handle as well as that of his office. Subsequent to this, the pain and uncertainty I expressed in my letter have been amplified to resonate through the country and our citizens throughout the world. The outpourings of anguish from citizens of Tamil Nadu and all over India, have joined forces with my voice addressed to our Prime Minister. I have addressed our Prime Minister on the most democratic public platform as this is a matter that is of the greatest public relevance and importance.Our Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji, has been one of, if not our earliest, political leaders to embrace the ways of today\\'s modern world. Most specifically in his wholehearted espousal of modern technology and social media. He has been a most vociferous proponent of utilising technology and digital and social media to make communication instantaneous and effective. He has reiterated time and again his accessibility on digital and social media platforms to the common citizen of India. There are several examples of his drive and initiatives to this effect but I will not digress in order to reiterate what is a very well-known fact.If we are to be told today that a letter that was addressed directly to our Prime Minister, the contents of which raged across our nation both on national media and social media, has escaped the notice of his office and therefore himself, it is an extremely devastating reality for us to face. As a political leader, who has promised to listen to his people and bring about true and meaningful change in the way this country has been governed through the past decades, this denying any knowledge even of a justified and rightful query from the very citizens of his country is disappointing to say the least. How is a citizen\\'s query, made with honest intent and immense grief, any less relevant because it has been delivered on a communication platform of modern technology?DOES TAMIL NADU NOT DESERVE PM\\'S ATTENTION, ASKS GAUTAMIIn the time since writing that letter, I have been steadfast in my faith in my Prime Minister. Faith in his accountability to the people of his nation as per the tenets of democracy. Faith in him as an individual leader who has shown the strength to take harsh and potentially unpopular steps for the betterment of this country. Faith in his word when he said the entire nation is one for him. Then why this denial now? Is south India and most specifically Tamil Nadu, not deserving of the attention and accountability of our central government? Yes, several members of the central government and other officials have travelled back and forth to Chennai during the period of Amma\\'s hospitalisation and \"treatment\" but have we, the people of Tamil Nadu, received even one response to any of our entreaties? To deny answers to our questions and deny justice to Amma is to deny Tamil Nadu itself. Why must we be forced to accept this apathy towards our anguish and uncertainty?AMMA\\'S DEMISEMy state has been battered for the past several months in unprecedented and shattering ways. Amma\\'s heartrendingly tragic demise that has left an indelible mark upon each of us in different ways. Cyclone Varadha that tore us up and ripped us apart in a storm of huge proportions. We are still, and will be struggling for a long time to come, with the devastating aftermath of this calamity. Our awe-inspiringly peaceful and rightful protest by the people of Tamil Nadu all over the world to uphold the age-old traditions of one of the oldest-known cultures in the world. Our farmers continue to be battered to the point of ending their lives out of sheer hopelessness, knowing their cries are unheard.Through all of these devastating happenings, I, we, have been waiting.Â\\xa0 Waiting and hopeful of meaningful support and response from our central government. Respectful of the demands of due process and the inner workings of government and politics. However, there must come a time when we must ask if this silence is more than a preoccupation with matters of \"greater\" importance. What is the message inherent in such a steadfast silence on a matter critical to the very basis of a democratic state and the safety and security of its citizens? A leading politician of our country and the serving chief minister of one of India\\'s foremost states has died in office under conditions that are shrouded in mystery and complete obscurity. As citizens of this state and this nation, we are entitled to have complete knowledge of these details. It is a fundamental confidence and security that a democratic nation owes her people. In addition to this, Amma is a leader who has a lasting and very real bond with crores of her people who love and respect her. Our anguish and our grief must be respected and honoured with answers.

We hope the process of procurement of 1,000 new buses is expedited,? a DTC official said.The government has proposed to procure 1,000 new standard floor buses, but it would take at least a year-and-a-half until they are pressed to service. The matter is yet to be put up in the cabinet after which tender documents would be prepared. Tendering would take at least six months and the next six months will be needed in getting the bus to the city. It has been over four years since buses were inducted to its fleet, even as three attempts to procure new ones have failed owing to tender issues, especially regarding their maintenance. The issue is that the maintenance cost of a bus is so high that manufacturers do not want to take the onus on them, officials said.While there are 3,781 low-floor buses plying in the Capital, it is the 170 standard floor buses that are the oldest (more than 10 years old) and will be condemned in the coming months.The DTC which is one of the oldest State Transport Units (STUs) of India is also worried that if things do not move quickly form here it would be left with only 6,517 employees by 2025 out of which 5052 will be regular drivers alone.

While delivering the order, principal judge of family court Dharmesh Sharma observed that the slow pace of the justice delivery system \"casts a very sickening feeling in my mind\" but added that the parties and their counsel too were perhaps responsible for the delay. Millions of cases are pending in India\\'s courts, draining litigants of resources and pointing towards an urgent need for more judges and judicial reforms. Courts too are encouraging such couples to first try mediation instead of getting into lengthy legal fights.DECISION AFTER 19 YEARS\"Unfortunate as it may look, this case is coming up for final decision after nineteen years of its institution initially before the family court. Most unfortunate aspect of this case is that the parties cohabited hardly for about 20 days before calamity struck the newly married bride, having pernicious repercussions on the mindset of her husband,\" said the judge.\"The marriage has irretrievably broken down despite the fact the parties are quite educated and hail from an affluent class of the society, and I only wish they should have settled their differences in an amicable manner instead of suffering the agony of a protracted matrimonial litigation.\" Thirumoorthy Ramakrishnan, 53, and Subhashini Bala Subramanian, 49, got married in 1998 after meeting through a matrimonial advertisement in a newspaper.WIFE ARRESTED IN CASE OF MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDSHowever, cops arrested the wife in Ooty when the newlyweds were on their way to visit South Indian temples as part of a custom that says a couple can\\'t consummate their marriage unless they have taken their blessings at these shrines. She was allegedly involved in a case of misappropriation of funds.The woman, who was then 29, was brought to Delhi for trial. On the last day of the remand, she told her husband that she was carrying his child. The man moved court, seeking dissolution of marriage on the grounds that following the arrest of his wife, he was interrogated by the police on a number of occasions. Inquiries were conducted at his workplace and his accounts were checked, causing deep mental and physical cruelty, making him subject of ridicule among his friends, colleagues and relatives, he argued.The husband also told the court that he learnt later that his wife had hidden her professional qualifications and other important details. He said the incident left him in constant tension, apprehending that he may be called by the police at any time for further investigation and sought divorce on the grounds of \"cruelty\".WOMAN DENIES ALLEGATIONSThe wife though claimed that all the allegations against her were false. She also said the couple had consummated before the completing the religious ritual. The wife did not deny the criminal proceedings initiated against her but said she was being falsely implicated in the case by her employer.She also said that her husband not only abandoned her at a time when she needed him the most but also abandoned the child born in wedlock and left them to fend for themselves.The court granted divorce, saying that the arrest, detention and criminal prosecution of the wife, whether innocent or not of the charges, so early into their marriage caused the husband exceptional hardship and was inflicted with intolerable mental cruelty. \"Protracted legal battles in our system end up spoiling a person\\'s life,\" Saurabh Chauhan, counsel for the husband, told Mail Today. \"A marriage going bad is an accident. It can happen to anyone.THE STATE OF THE COUPLE NOWHad the divorce been granted in a year or two, my client could have remarried and have had a family now and led a normal life. He is an old man now and not in a state to marry. Instead of getting relief, the long battles themselves become the problem.\"Mail Today has learnt that the husband has moved abroad and works in a bank while the wife is working as an accountant. Their daughter passed class 12 this year and scored 94 per cent in the board examinations.Anil Sharma, counsel for the wife, told that they have moved the high court in appeal. \"The charges levelled by the husband on my client also amount to cruelty.

A lot of effort has also been put into her look in the film, since the makers wanted her appearance and mannerisms to be \"exactly like Jayalalithaa\\'s,\" according to a source.However, director Kushan Nandy told the publication that there is no truth to these reports. \"Our film is fictional.

However, Kohli denied that as mere speculation. But Kumble, soon after resigning, issued a statement and clarified he was quitting because the captain did not like his style of coaching.Malhotra\\'s report was rather guarded despite clear differences between the coach and the captain.\"There was harmony in the dressing room, the coaches Mr Anil Kumble, Mr Bangar, Mr Sridhar & senior players like Mr MS Dhoni & Mr Yuvraj Singh were helpful to the younger players,\" Malhotra said in his report.However, Malhotra, who attended all team meetings on the eve of matches, said he did not see \"much communication between captain and coach.\"India Today had also broken how communication between Kohli and Kumble had broken down for the past several months.Here is the full report:I hear by duly submit my report, Champions Trophy 2017.The arrangements made byÂ\\xa0 ICC at the airports both when we landed & left were excellent, the hotels where we were put up were good. Our local liaison Mr Vasant Bhatt was very accommodating and helpful.Mr Peter Spinks our security in charge provided by ICC, worked very well with our security manager Mr Jaidev Joshi.Our staff performed there functions with sincerity and dedication.Before the tournament began, I had meetings with Mr Chris Tetley Head of events, meeting with Mr Neeraj Kumar & Miss Jill Mccraacken tournament safety & security manager, attended ACSU meetings. Had a meeting with Mr David Boon match Refree along with head coach Mr Anil Kumble.Both ICC venue managers Oval, Mr Dhiraj Malhotra and Edgbaston, Miss Sarah Edgar were very helpful & cooperative.Our Captain Mr Virat Kohli was very positive, was always approachable & respectful, even when the team had a bad day on the field, he encouraged the players to go out & express themselves & perform better, in the team meetings he spoke about intensity required on the field & led by example.All the team members got along well & behaved like true professionals & were always seen encouraging each other.There was harmony in the dressing room, the coaches Mr Anil Kumble, Mr Bangar, Mr Sridhar & senior players like Mr MS Dhoni & Mr Yuvraj Singh were helpful to the younger players.Team meetings were held one day before all the games, which I attended.Team selections were held one day before, both the selectors Mr MSK Prasad, Mr Devang Gandhi, head coach Mr Anil Kumble,Captian Mr Kohli & myself attended the meetings, the selection for all the games was unanimous. The minutes of the selection committee meeting are ready in hard copy.Initially When I met Mr Anil Kumble I found him to be slightly reserved, butÂ\\xa0 as the tournament progressed I found him more approachable. I must add that I did not see much communication between the Coach & the Captain, personally I did not witness any arguments between the two.The Team members played well throughout the tournament & gave there 100 percent, it was unfortunate that we did not win the final.SuggestionsGoing forward, would suggest that there is enough time given to the squad to rest when they arrive, after long flights, before they start there activities, at least a couple of days, because If you see the scheduling, the day we got into London in the morning, within a few hours the Captain had to attend the arrival press conference, then captains photo shoot, then the entire squad had to attend Anti-Doping educational briefing along with ACU educational briefing. The next day we were at Lords practicing.Enough water should be provided in team rooms at the hotel, we were provided 2 crates of water which was not sufficient.Security concernsThere were 3 incidents reported by our security manager.1. On the final day of the tournament after the prize distribution ceremony, as the players were walking up the steps, one of the spectators said something to Mr Shami, who was upset initially, but let go of the incident as it could have got the spectator into trouble, this could have been avoided had there been more distance between the spectators & the team members.2. When we were about to leave the Oval after the finals, we were informed by our security manager that a minor incident had taken place with the door of the team bus, this was sorted out & the team bus arrived a little late.3. Our team analyst Mr Tulli left his passport & money at the hotel in his room locker, in Birmingham, our security officer informed the hotel regarding this, only the passport was returned & we were informed there was no money found in the locker.

On July 11 and 12 combined, it received about 150,000.After users seemingly tried to change the article?s content to say the font was available from 2004, Wikipedia suspended editing on its Calibri page ?until July 18 2017, or until editing disputes have been resolved?.One supporter hailed the move, saying people seeking to edit the page ?are trying to save a corrupt political party on corruption charges?. Others praised Wikipedia for its quick response and said it was proof of the company?s integrity.Opposition parties have urged prime minister Nawaz Sharif to step down after the investigation found a ?significant disparity? between his family?s declared wealth and known sources of income.Opposition leader Imran Khan said Sharif had ?lost all moral authority? and must resign immediately.Sharif has denied wrongdoing and said his family?s wealth was acquired legally.', \"A bar in Kerala has come up with an exceptional way to get around the new rule banning alcohol near highways.Aishwarya Restobar in Paravoor, Ernakulam, now has a full-blown maze around the building, much like in Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire (the Triwizard Tournament, duh?).Reason?After the Supreme Court ruled a ban on the sale of liquor within 500 metres of national/state highways, things became difficult for Aishwarya Restobar as it was situated near NH 17.

But even the 22-year-old did not expect what happened ? a 0.47sec improvement on the world record of 26.42sec he set in winning the 50m title in Kazan, Russia in 2015.Peaty clocked 26.10 in the morning heat, 0.44 ahead of his nearest rival, and improved his mark to 25.95 in the evening semi-final, 0.73sec clear of the field.?I didn?t think I was going to do that,? said Peaty, who shook his head in disbelief after seeing his time.

He said: ?This morning everyone was like Project 25 and I was like ?go on then?. I just dived in tonight and was like ?I feel good?.

Commenting on the outcome of the GST Council meeting that concluded today, CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said that classification of goods under different tax slabs of GST are by and large fitted in the correct basket and it is expected that goods will become cheaper under the new indirect tax regime. \"However, on the other side, several items which have been placed under higher category of tax rate will disturb the pricing structure and pinch the common man,\" said B C Bhartia, president of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT). He pointed out that items like pickles, sauces, and instant mixer pertaining to food processing which are consumed by large number of people, have been placed under the higher tax rate of 18 per cent. The CAIT further said that while the GST should be implemented from the scheduled date of July 1, the remaining nine months of the current fiscal \"may be declared as trial period\" and except habitual offenders, no action should be taken against traders for procedural mistakes.

Five more men who were with him told her that they had come to raid the house. Before my wife could understand anything, the men pushed her inside,? said Khandelwal.For the next 10 minutes ? shortly after 1.30pm ? the suspects held a gun to Khandelawal?s four-year-old grandson Divyansh as they rummaged through the house before escaping with gold and diamond jewellery worth around Rs 20 lakh. The police said the incident, which took place on Wednesday, was the first time robbers had posed as police officers to carry out an armed robbery in a home in the middle of the day.Mandeep Singh Randhawa, the deputy commissioner of police (central), said a case of robbery and theft has been registered but the suspects are yet to be identified. ?One of them put a pistol to Divyansh?s head and threatened to kill him if anybody screamed for help or raised an alarm,? said the 61-year-old jewellery Besides Khandelwal?s wife Urmila and the child, the robbers held his daughter-in-law Megha hostage. One of the men took the keys to a locker from Megha and he ransacked the locker. The hold-up would have likely lasted longer had Khandelwal?s other daughter-in-law, Preeti, not spotted it and raised an alarm. Her scream?s led the men to flee, Khandlewal said, adding that they did not touch the cash and other jewellery in the house. The attack had left Urmila, 58, with a fracture in the left shoulder and Megha with a broken right foot.Three teams have been formed to investigate the case. The teams are collecting details about criminals who operate using similar methods, and are poring over electronic surveillance and human intelligence networks. The data of mobile phones active in the area during the crime are also being analysed for clues.

The 52-year-old British novelist, best known as the author of the Harry Potter fantasy series, said yesterday that she deleted her July 28 tweets after she was informed that they were \"not a full or accurate representation\" of what had happened at last Mondays health care event at the White House. Rowling came under fire for a series of now-deleted tweets in which she slammed Trump for seeming to ignore Montgomery Weers outstretched hand. \"How stunning, and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the president,\" the author had said. But Marjorie Kelly Weer, mother of Montgomery, said Rowlings interpretation of the clip was wrong. \"Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proffered hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage. Multiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction,\" Rowling tweeted. \"I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly,\" she wrote.

Police by then had managed to identify Saifullah\\'s relatives and decided to rope them in to talk him into surrendering.Senior police officers opened channels of communication and made his Kanpur-based brother Khalid speak to him for at least one hour. Saifullah, however, was not receptive; rather he was hostile and did not respond. He was \"screaming that he wanted to die\".FOCUS ON STUDIES, SAID FATHER His brother Khalid then tried to bring in their father Sartaj to talk to him. Sartaj was in tears and tried his best to convince him but in vain. He told Saifullah that he should devote himself to studies and not terror activities. At one point, his brother Khalid invoked Prophet Mohammad and asked Saifullah to give up in the name of Prophet. Saifullah, however, was not prepared to listen to anything. Officers said he was indoctrinated to a point where family members found it impossible to make him see the other side. \"His family members were shattered when they discovered that someone who had spent his childhood and best years of his life with them was not willing to listen to them at all,\" said a senior police officer.

The Prime Minister would meet President Donald Trump face-to-face for the first time at the White House on Monday. \"I think that the US really appreciates India, and I think that President Trump realises that India has been a force for good in the world and that its a relationship thats important. And I think that will come through in the visit on Monday,\" the official said. The senior administration official made the remarks while responding to questions on whether the US-India relationship has drifted under the new government, in part, because of President Trump and the administrations support to China. \"I think its a bit unfair. I mean, were only six months into the administration. But there have been two very good phone calls between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi that you can point to as showing both countries interest in the relationship,\" the White House official argued. \"Yes, this will be the first opportunity for them to sit down and have a conversation, but I think that this is still fairly early on in the administration,\" the official said. Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said President Trump and Prime Minister Modi would have a very robust discussion when they meet at the White House. \"During the meeting, the President and the Prime Minister will discuss ongoing cooperation, including counter-terrorism, defence partnership in the Indo-Pacific region, global cooperation, burden-sharing, trade, law enforcement, and energy,\" Spicer said in response to a question. Senator Mark Warner, Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus hoped that Trump, in his meeting with Prime Minister Modi, shows enthusiastic support for deepening the US-India relationship, which enjoys strong bipartisan support. \"The relationship is ripe for additional cooperation in areas such as the development of aircraft carrier technology, space surveillance, unmanned aerial vehicles, cyber and increased defense manufacturing,\" Warner said. \"As we venture further into the Asian Century, there is little doubt of the increasing significance of India on the world stage. Our cooperation helps increase global security and advance economic opportunity in both countries,\" Warner said in response to a question. On whether the contentious H-1B visa issue would come up for discussion during the meeting, a senior administration official said it was unlikely to be raised from the US side but if raised by the Indian side, the Americans were ready for it. Ahead of the visit, Indian Ambassador to the US Navtej Sarna said the first face-to-face meeting between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump will give them an opportunity to look at the entire gamut of Indo-US engagement and to exchange views on issues of global interest. At the invitation of Trump, the Prime Minister would spend several hours with the US President at the White House on Monday afternoon, which would end with a dinner later that night. This would be the first working dinner being hosted by Trump for a foreign leader at the White House. \"I think that just shows the amount of care that has gone in on the part of the White House to welcome our Prime Minister and the kind of planning that has gone into make this a very special visit,\" Sarna said. \"This (dinner) is a special gesture and it is appreciated,\" he said. On the agenda of the meeting, a senior administration official told reporters that the civil nuclear deal would be part of the discussions between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump. The White House also emphasised that the US was looking forward to its nuclear reactors contributing to Indias energy security. It said the US is interested in providing India with the kind of defence technology it normally reserves for its closest allies, signalling the Trump administrations resolve to strengthen the bilateral defence relationship. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar here and told him that Prime Minister Modis Washington visit would strengthen the Indo-US relationship and help advance the common interest in fighting terrorism and promoting economic growth.

Although he is not the first ever Indian chinaman blower as that tag belongs to Preeti Dimri, he became the first ever chinaman bowler to earn a call-up in the Indian Test team. (Also read: India vs Bangladesh one-off Test: Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav replaces injured Amit Mishra)Not only that, he is only the second bowler in Indian cricket currently who belongs to a rare breed. The other one is Shivil Kaushik, who took people by surprise with his Paul Adams-esque \"frog in a blender\"Â\\xa0 bowling action when he played for the Gujarat Lions last year in the Indian Premier League.WHAT IS CHINAMAN?So what is Chinaman bowling? In layman\\'s term it\\'s basically left-arm leg-spin - the same as right-arm leg-spin. While a leg spinner turns the ball away from the right hander, a chinaman bowler brings it back into him, which can sometimes make life difficult. As a right-handed batsman, your natural instinct is to expect the ball to turn away from you . It\\'s also called left-arm unorthodox spin.This a rare type and is actually considered to be more dangerous because of the sharp turn it generates into a right hander or away from the left hander.VARIATIONS OF A CHINAMAN BOWLERWell, it is traditionally wrist spin. A chinaman bowler has the normal variations of a normal wrist spin bowler. The stock ball comes into the right hander and leaves a left handed batsman. If he possesses \\' a \\'Googly\\', the ball is supposed to leave the right hander and come into the left hander.Â\\xa0WHY CHINAMAN?The term is traditionally believed to have originated with the former West Indian spinner Ellis Achong. Back in 1933, England hosted West Indies in a Test match in Old Trafford. Achong, said to be a left-arm orthodox spinner or slow left-arm as it is popularly said bowled an unexpected delivery from his wrist which got a sharp turn after pitching outside off and got the English batsman Walter Robins stumped. Achong was the first Test cricketer of Chinese origin and it is believed that a perplexed and angry Robins commented while walking towards the pavilion -Â\\xa0 \"Fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman.\"From then, left-arm wrist spinners have been referred to as chinaman bowlers.HISTORY OF CHINAMAN BOWLINGWell, this is a rare breed all together. So much so that there have been only around 30 of them in international cricket. Out of these only 16 - Achong,Â\\xa0 Chuck Fleetwood-Smith,Â\\xa0 George Tribe,Â\\xa0 Johnny Wardle, Garfield Sobers,Â\\xa0 Lindsay Kline,Â\\xa0 Johnny Martin,Â\\xa0 David Sincock, Inshan Ali, Bernard Julien, Paul Adams, Brad Hogg, Beau Casson, Dave Mohammed, Michael Rippon and Lakshan Sandakan are the ones who made the teams solely due to their bowling.Now one might wonder that what is the legendary Garry Sobers doing in the list? He was a left-arm fast bowler - well, he used to turn his wrist once in a while as well, to add one more dimension to his game. Even Achong, Tribe, Wardle and Martin were not specialised chinaman bowlers as they used to bowl finger spin as well.WHO MADE IT BIG?Not many have mastered the art really.

Call it a \"political opinion,\" and he corrects you - \"It\\'s my national opinion. My opinions are about my country. They are not representative of any political ideology. It\\'s a very cliched thing to call any opinion about the country a political opinion.\"Many people believe that actors should stay away from talking about anything unrelated to films. In fact, if an actor has an opinion, especially one that is not popular, they get trolled. Kher tells IndiaToday.in, in an exclusive interview, \"Acting is a part of my life, it\\'s not my life. I\\'m an individual; I\\'m a citizen of this country, I\\'m a teacher, I\\'m a motivational speaker, I\\'m a writer, I\\'m a son. Just because everyone may not agree with me, doesn\\'t mean I\\'ll stop putting forth what I want to say. In life, you cannot make everyone happy. And you don\\'t necessarily stop talking to those who don\\'t agree with you. You have to, as a celebrity, learn the art of ignoring. Yes, of course, you get upset and unhappy sometimes. But it\\'s alright, I have been in this business for a long time.\"While B-Towners from Shah Rukh Khan to Aamir Khan had expressed their concern that India was becoming increasingly intolerant, Anupam Kher had begged to differ. But when Sanjay Leela Bhansali is thrashed and his Padmavati sets are attacked for allegedly distorting the glorious Rajput history, does it not smack of intolerance? The actor says that \"it is very unfortunate,\" but not does think intolerance is the reason.\"I think the media gives it great importance. The problem is that if a bunch of 10 people doing something like this gets nationally covered, then they know that this is how they will get noticed... But on a level of what they have done, it\\'s absolutely not right. It should not have happened. Nobody can dictate what should be made and what should not be made,\" he emphasises.Anupam Kher, who was the censor chief from 2003-04, also said that the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) rules need to be revisited. \"The rules were written in 1952. The present government had appointed a committee headed by Shyam Benegal. I don\\'t know what happened to the recommendations. They need to be implemented. Rules toh ban jaate hai, unko implement nahi kiya jaata,\" the actor said.Anupam Kher will be seen next in Naam Shabana, which is scheduled to release on March 31.

', 'A Family Welfare Committee (FWC) in every district will scrutinise dowry harassment cases before local police can arrest the accused, the Supreme Court said on Thursday, laying down a set of guidelines to curb misuse of the law.Indian Penal Code?s Section 498A has been criticised for giving ?disgruntled women? a legal option to harass their husbands, and Thursday?s orders take forward measures announced by the top court in 2014 when it prohibited automatic arrests.A bench of justices AK Goel and UU Lalit barred the police from making direct arrest and said the involvement of civil society was necessary ?to achieve the laudable object of punishing cruelty at the hands of husbands or his relatives against the wife?.Quoting the National Crime Records Bureau?s 2012 data, the bench said that a quarter of all arrests were those of women ? mothers and sisters of husbands ? and while chargesheets were filed at an ?exponentially high 93.6%? of cases, only 14.4% ended in convictions. The report projected that out of the 3,72,706 cases pending trial in 2012, as many as 3,17,000 were projected to lead to acquittals.Curbing misuseForm 3-member committee in every district of para-legal volunteers, social workers, working officers? wives or suitable citizensDecide bail applications on same day as far as possibleGrant exemption from personal appearance or allow it by videoconferencingDon?t make passport impounding or red corner notice routine for people residing out of IndiaThe court, however, put a rider to its restrictions, saying that they were not valid in offences involving tangible physical injury or death.?It is a matter of serious concern that large number of cases continues to be filed under Section 498A alleging harassment of married women. To remedy the situation, we are of the view that involvement of civil society in the aid of administration of justice can be one of the steps, apart from the investigating officers and the concerned trial courts being sensitised,? the bench said.The top court also ordered that trial courts must decide bail applications in such cases on the same day as far as possible. Recovery of disputed dowry items may not by itself be a ground for denial of bail if maintenance or other rights of wife/minor children can otherwise be protected, SC said.According to the ruling, the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) will form the committee comprising three members who could be para-legal volunteers, social workers, retired persons, wives of working officers or citizens who may be found suitable and willing.A dowry harassment complaint to the police or magistrate will be referred to the committee that can interact with the parties personally or through electronic communication. The committee must submit its report to the authority, which refers the complaint to it within a month.Till the report is received, no arrest should be effected, the court said. After considering the report on its own merit, the police or magistrate will proceed with further action.SC also directed that only a designated Investigating Officer of the area shall investigate dowry harassment cases. Such designations must be done within a month, the court said. These officers must be trained, which the court held must be completed within four months.In further directions to lower courts, the SC said that accused should be exempted from appearing in person or be allowed to appear via video conferencing as far as that does not adversely affect the progress of the case.In cases where accused is residing out of India, impounding of passports or red corner notice should not be a routine, the court said.In cases where a settlement is reached, it will be open to a district and sessions judge or any other senior judicial officer nominated by him in the district to complete the proceedings including the closing of the criminal case if dispute primarily relates to matrimonial discord. Committee?s functioning may be reviewed once a year, SC added.In 2014, a separate bench had criticised the law?s misuse and said: ?The fact that Section 498-A is a cognisable and non-bailable offence has lent it a dubious place of pride amongst the provisions that are used as weapons rather than shield by disgruntled wives?.', 'Israel is removing metal detectors from entrances to the compound that houses al-Aqsa mosque.The move was announced late on Monday night by the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and is designed to end a crisis over the holy site. Days of violent confrontations have claimed seven lives.Despite the Israeli announcement, however, a senior Muslim cleric in Jerusalem said worshippers should stay away from the shrine pending a review of the new Israeli security arrangements there.Ikrema Sabri, the head of the Supreme Islamic Committee in the city, said such a review may be completed later on Tuesday. Sabri said: ?Our position is that for now, nobody should enter? the shrine.The removal of the detectors on Tuesday appeared to be part of a deal under which Israeli diplomats were repatriated from Jordan, including an embassy security guard who was involved in a fatal shooting of two Jordanians on Sunday night.The brief statement said the Israeli security cabinet, which met on Monday evening, had ?accepted the recommendation of all of the security bodies to incorporate security measures based on advanced technologies (?smart checks?) and other measures instead of metal detectors in order to ensure the security of visitors and worshippers in the Old City and on the Temple Mount?.The statement added that under the plan Israeli police would ?reinforce? their presence around the holy site. It did not say when the metal detectors would be removed or what would replace them. Israeli media earlier reported that high-resolution cameras capable of detecting hidden objects would be the alternative.Earlier on Monday the UN?s Middle East envoy warned of the dangers of allowing the crisis to continue. ?It is extremely important that a solution to the current crisis be found by Friday this week,? Nickolay Mladenov said after briefing the UN security council. ?The dangers on the ground will escalate if we go through another cycle of Friday prayer without a resolution.? He said events in east Jerusalem were not ?localised? but ?affect millions if not billions of people around the world?.Even before the Israeli decision to remove the devices, it was unclear whether such a move would be sufficient to end the violence. Muslim religious officials ? who allege Israel is trying to expand its control at the site ? said they would accept only a return to the arrangements for access to the compound that had been in place before an incident on 14 Julywhen two Israeli policemen were shot by three Israeli Arab gunmen who had smuggled weapons on to the site.?This movement is a movement of the street,? said Sheikh Raed Dana of the waqf, the Islamic endowments organisation that administers the mosque compound, commenting on whether he believed worshippers should end protests and return to the shrine. ?We as the waqf listen to the street. The street says yes and we say yes; if the street says no to the measures, we will say no.?There has been increasing criticism of the way the metal detectors were installed, without consultation with the waqf and reportedly over the objections of senior Israeli security officials who had warned of the risk of bloodshed.On Monday night Israeli diplomats were evacuated from the embassy in the Jordanian capital, Amman, after Sunday?s shooting of two Jordanians by a security guard.The diplomats, including Israel?s ambassador to Jordan, Einat Schlain, crossed the Allenby bridge border in a convoy, arriving back in Israel at around 11pm. Among those repatriated were the security guard whom Jordan had originally said it wanted to retain for questioning over the incident.A Jordanian news site linked to the kingdom?s military said investigators had determined that the altercation at the embassy compound was not politically motivated and that one of the Jordanians, a 17-year-old, had attacked the guard with a screwdriver in a dispute about a furniture delivery.Under an agreement negotiated by the head of Israel?s domestic security service, who had been sent to Amman to negotiate, Israel agreed that Jordanian police could hear the guard?s description of the incident in the presence of Israeli diplomats.Netanyahu?s office said the return of the diplomats had been made possible ?thanks to close cooperation which was held in the past day between Israel and Jordan?.', 'Lucknow, Dec 24 (PTI) Taking a dig at Narendra Modis demonetisation move, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav termed cashless economy as a \"bigger dream\" than achche din and said the note ban will be an issue in the upcoming Assembly elections in the state. \"The dream of cashless economy is a bigger one than achche din... it is however for the government to see how it will be realised,\" he said at a function to distribute cheques to the families of martyrs and 14 persons who allegedly lost their lives while standing in queues outside ATMs/banks after demonetisation. Attacking the BJP government on note ban, Yadav, without taking names, alleged that people have been betrayed and economy harmed. \"Earlier (when the note ban was announced) people had faith, or rather confusion, that a big change will be brought... but soon after the very same people started saying that there could not have been a bigger loss to the economy... national and international economists are also writing about it. \"It is for the government to see how it will work out the losses to the GDP but it is a fact the people had to face hardships and I have said earlier too that the government which pose problems are voted out by people,\" he said, adding that in the coming elections those who had faced problems will stand against them. Uttar Pradesh is the first state in the country to announce compensation for the families of those who allegedly died while queuing up outside banks and ATMs for long post demonetisation. Chief Minister had earlier this month announced Rs 2 lakh compensation for the families of demonetisation victims. ', 'Kolkata, Apr 17 (PTI) The underwater tunnel of East-West Metro Corridor Project here, built below the Ganga river bed, is the first of its kind in the country, said Union Minister Babul Supriyo today after going into the tunnel. \"This is the first such project in the country. Building a tunnel under the river had never taken place elsewhere in India. Further being built under Ganga, it has an emotional value as well,\" Supriyo, who went inside the tunnel between slab numbers 820 and 840, said. He has been asked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to personally supervise the work, said Supriyo while interacting with the officials of Afcons-Transtonnelstroy of South Africa, the agency to build the tunnel between Howrah Maidan and the proposed Mahakaran metro station near Writers Buildings here. Supriyo also collected soil from the place and kept it in two utensils - one for gifting to the prime minister and another for himself as a memento. The entire stretch of tunnel from Howrah Maidan to the Ganga bank in the city will be 1.7 km, of which a significant part will be on the surface. \"Basically, we reached almost the bottom of the Ganga and spent a considerable time (there). It was an exhilarating experience. I salute the engineers and the workers for the heroic work,\" Supriyo, the Union Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises said. Asked about the safety of the project, he said \"Let me allay any apprehension about the safety. We did not feel uncomfortable inside though we were 32 m below the river water - that is the sea level.\" He said the tunnel went under buildings like Howrah Station but there were no threat to them as the latest technology had been used. The tunnel boring machine (TBM), used in the excavation work, will now go beyond the slab number 840 to dig up earth under the river bed and finally reach the east bank - that is the city. Expressing hope that the Howrah Maidan-Esplanade part of Phase II of the project, which would connect Howrah Maidan to Sealdah) will not miss the deadline, Supriyo said \"We expect to clear the logjam in the wake of the existing rule that infrastructure projects would not come up within 100 m of the heritage buildings.\" \"There are three heritage constructions - two synagogues and the Currency Building within 30 m of the proposed tunnel. But IIT-Kharagpur in a feasibility study said the tunnel work and metro movement would not cause any damage to the structures.\" \"We are not setting up a time-frame and the Union cabinet is preparing a note to exempt the Metro work. Lets hope for the best,\" he said. The entire second phase of the East West Project, with 100 per cent funding by the Centre, had been facilitated by the West Bengal government with intervention by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her cabinet colleagues to clear settlements. Phase 1 of the East-West Metro Corridor Project, he said, is expected to be completed on time and thanked Banerjee for removing encroachments along the route. \"During my chance meeting with the West Bengal CM in 2015 which the media had christened as Jhalmuri diplomacy, I had broached the topic of encroachment and with the intervention of TMC leaders it was resolved. \"The encroachers will be relocated in a new building in the area,\" he said.

The construction will begin shortly after the foundation-laying ceremony is held in September,? said Achal Khare, managing director, National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRC).Being constructed over railway land measuring 4,400 metres at an estimated cost of Rs 600 crore, the training centre will have a sample track fitted with the overhead electrical systems to enable testing of bullet trains that will run on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad route.While India?s first bullet train is proposed to hit the track in 2023, the training centre is supposed to start operating by 2020, Khare told HT.The training of 4,000 rail engineers has been envisaged before 2020. Approximately 300 of these will be trained in Japan, while the rest will undergo courses at the Gandhinagar centre. A maintenance depot for high speed rolling stock is also proposed to be set up at the existing railway facility at Sabarmati. ?The existing utilities at the centre are currently being shifted,? Khare said.Civil work on the ambitious project ? which has the NHRSC, the Japan International Consultants for Transportation (JIC), Nippon Koei Co and the Oriental Consultants Global Company Limited as general consultants ? is expected to start in 2018.The process of acquiring 800 hectares required for the project will also begin next year.

Some wonder if this march would rightly pave way to address not just white woman's feminism but the over-all issue of equality and human rights.We cannot certify what this would lead to but, at least, one cannot deny that such a mass uprising is commendable in its very approach of flagging issues that might impact civilisation in general.Among those numerous posters and placards that made news, what caught one's eye are women wearing colourful hijabs.

If the order goes against any party (the hotel or NDMC), they can appeal within 12 days at the district court,? the official said.The NDMC had earlier ordered action against four of its officials over alleged irregularities in the recovery of dues that the five-star hotel owed the civic body. HT had earlier reported how the civic body in its report to the ministry of home affairs recommended major penalties against the officials. In March this year, the luxury hotel?s licence was cancelled by the NDMC over non-payment of dues to the tune of Rs 523 crore.The four have been accused of lowering the dues amount by diluting a formula (to calculate dues) ordered by high court. The four officers mentioned in the report are the then director estate, one deputy director estate, a senior accounts officer and a senior assistant. According to a senior council official, a committee ? including chief vigilance officer, director vigilance, director personnel, secretary, financial advisor and director estate ? conducted the internal probe. In March this year, the council decided to act against Le Meridien over non-payment of licence fees pending for three decades. ?The dispute has been going on since 1982. Till date, the total amount owed by them has accumulated to around Rs 523 crore. Now, in accordance with the Public Premises Eviction Act-1971, the matter is being referred to the NDMC estate officer and the hotel has been declared as an unauthorized occupant. The estate officer will take the final call in this regard,? he said.A spokesperson for Le Meridien, when contacted, said, ?The matter is sub judice, so we would not like to comment on it?.', 'Kangana Ranaut was injured after being accidentally struck by a prop sword on the sets of her new film, Manikarnika - The Queen Of Jhansi.

Reports earlier emerged that the Mumbai event, scheduled for January had been cancelled after authorities failed to give the go-ahead for the show. In a statement issued late Friday night, Percept, the event's organizer, said that the concert has been rescheduled for January 15.

Reports of Guetta's Mumbai concert getting cancelled came right on the heels of the artist's Bengaluru show being scrapped. Controversy erupted after the organizers initially said that the reason for the cancellation was the law and order situation faced by the local police following incidents of alleged mass molestation on New Year's Eve. Bengaluru police fired back saying permission for the event had never been issued, adding that the organizers approached them for permission just two days before the concert date. Authorities added that they did not ask that the event be cancelled but only directed the organizers to reschedule it for a different date as the January 12 concert was clashing with local APMC polls.

Addressing his daily press briefing, Spicer was asked about the upcoming Donald Trump-Narendra Modi meeting at the White House. In response, Spicer said that he\\'d first like to \"wish the people of India a happy 70th anniversary on their independence.\"The question, asked by a reporter identified only as \\'Goyal\\', was about the expectations from Trump and Modi\\'s June 26 meeting in Washington, DC.

The cages were kept outside the forest and the animal was trapped only when it stepped out,? he said.How was the leopard caught?The three-year-old leopard was caught in the cage around 5.30am on Saturday in the phase-I portion of the 457-acre park in North Delhi. When the animal was caught, scientists observed that its belly was flattened as if it had not eaten for a few days.CR Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE), which manages the biodiversity park, said that the animal had wandered into phase-I of the park, which does not have enough prey base.?Phase 2 of the park, where the animal was spotted initially, is an active floodplain where there is ample prey base. In fact when animal was first spotted, its belly was hanging, which shows that it was well-fed. This was also the reason why it probably came out of the biodiversity park, where it was caught,? he said.Shukla concurred with the view. ?We had to move the camera traps and the cage according to the movement of the animal. The cages were set up on the banks of the river where locals have illegally cultivated patches of land,? he confirmed. The leopard under observation at Delhi Zoo in New Delhi on Saturday, after it was caught.What happens to the animal now?Shukla said that the leopard will be taken to the Rajaji National Park in Shivalik Ranges near Saharanpur, to its natural habitat. The animal is likely to be moved on Sunday. The carnivore was taken to the Delhi zoo where its health conditions were tested. Though no external injuries were seen, the animal is still being tested for internal injuries. Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of NGO Wildlife SOS, said that their team received a call from the forest department around 9am to help transport the leopard to the zoo. By afternoon around 2pm, the animal was shifted to the zoo, he said.Read: Leopard spotted last month at Yamuna Biodiversity Park, caught?The male leopard was first tranquilised and then transported in an ambulance cum rescue vehicle,? a statement released by the NGO read. Experts not happyWildlife and leopard experts are not happy with this capture and say that this was a ?politically motivated? step.Vidya Athreya, ecologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society, said that this move was taken without much thought. ?Capturing the leopard is not a solution. Leopards are known to stay near human habitation. What will you do if more leopards come to the park?? she asked.Athreya said that if the animal is shifted it will increase the chances of it harming humans.?The shock of being trapped confuses the animal and makes it more violent. Leaving it into a new environment will confuse it further and it might harm the humans in the nearby villages. We have seen such instances in Maharashtra in the past,? she said.Studies have shown that leopards have a strong homing tendency that leads them to head back towards the area they were removed from. Guidelines released by the environment ministry in 2011 say, the ?mere sighting of a leopard in the vicinity of human habitations does not necessarily mean that the animal has strayed from a forest and needs to be captured. Arbitrary removal of leopards could lead to increased conflict. The space vacated by a captured animal will soon be occupied by another leopard.?Babu too agreed with Athreya saying that the cycle of a healthy ecosystem will be disturbed by the removal of the animal from here.?With the removal of the top carnivore, the number of herbivores in the ecosystem will multiply. We hope more leopards come into the park and till then we can learn our lessons,? he said. How to avoid conflict?In conflict situations, rather than the management of the animal, it is often a management of people that assumes primacy.Wildlife biologist and expert on leopards, Sanjay Gubbi said that in situations where a leopard becomes visible, people gather and agitate the animal ? rather than letting it leave from the area. ?People living around the area should be educated of how to manage a leopard spotting,? he said.', 'After staying away from social media for so many years, Katrina Kaif gave into the temptation only a few months ago.

', 'The UN has dropped the superhero Wonder Woman as an ambassador for empowering girls and women after a brief stint that drew widespread criticism.The campaign around the comic book character, who turned 75 this autumn, lasted for less than two months. Among its key aims were challenging female stereotypes and fighting discrimination and violence against women and girls.But the appointment prompted an angry backlash from some quarters. More than 44,000 people signed a petition that claimed to have been started by ?concerned United Nations staff members? which called on the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to appoint a non-fictional woman to the role.?It is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualised image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls,? the petition?s authors wrote.Her scanty clothing ? ?a shimmery, thigh-baring bodysuit with an American flag motif and knee-high boots? ? meant that deploying her as a role model for the UN was culturally insensitive in many parts of the world, the petition added.Wonder Woman?s tenure as an honorary ambassador was launched on 21 October with an event that saw a silent protest by audience members who turned their backs on the panel, which included current and former Wonder Woman actors Gal Gadot and Lynda Carter.Others protested in the lobby, holding up signs that said ?I?m not a mascot? and ?Let?s get real?.Diane Nelson, president of DC Entertainment, the Warner Bros subsidiary behind Wonder Woman, told the event the campaign would feature various initiatives ?over the course of the next year?, suggesting that the partnership was envisaged to last into 2017.But now the UN has confirmed Wonder Woman?s time as an honorary ambassador will end this week. ?From the UN?s side, there was no plan for it to be much longer than this,? said Jeffrey Brez, the UN?s chief of NGO relations and advocacy.DC Entertainment had approached the UN to explore a joint project to mark the character?s 75th birthday, Brez said. The campaign aimed to harness Wonder Woman?s popularity to allow the UN to target new audiences with its messages on equality for women and girls.The angry response in some quarters prompted the UN to make celebrating the achievements of ?real-life Wonder Women? one of the campaign?s core goals.The collaboration had lasted longer than previous UN roles given to fictional characters, Brez added, pointing out that a character from the video game Angry Birds served as climate change ambassador for a single day in March.Other fictional characters to have been given honorary roles include Winnie the Pooh as honorary ambassador for friendship in 1997, and Tinkerbell as honorary ambassador for ?green? to promote environmental awareness in 2009.Warner Bros and DC Entertainment have been ?extremely pleased? with the partnership?s role in raising awareness of the empowerment of women and girls, a spokeswoman said.?Wonder Woman stands for peace, justice and equality, and for 75 years she has been a motivating force for many and will continue to be long after the conclusion of her UN honorary ambassadorship.?', 'Successor to the legendary Orpheus, audio giant Senheiser\\'s new HE 1 headphones are now available in India. And just like the legendary Orpheus, the new HE 1 will cost you a bomb to own. Senheiser has launched the premium, high-end headphones in India at an alarmingly high price tag of Rs 45,00,000. But, if the HE 1 are anywhere near as close as the headphones they will replace, well, they ought to be expensive. Â\\xa0\"For a decade now in the Indian market, Sennheiser has shaped the industry and has been at the cutting edge of audio by continuously re-defining the gold standard of what is technically possible,\" said Sennheiser CEO Daniel Sennheiser. \"With the HE 1, we are once again pushing the boundaries and are showing that we can repeatedly set new benchmarks in excellence and reshape the future of the high-end audio world.\"The new HE1 use a completely new amplifier concept that combines the superior impulse processing of a tube amplifier with the low distortion of a transistor amplifier \"to perfection\" according to the company. There are a total of eight vacuum tubes that process the incoming signal. The advantage of tube amplifiers is their superior impulse processing. However, one challenge is their sensitivity to air-borne-noise. For this reason, the amplifier housing is crafted from granular, in homogeneous Carrara marble and is freely suspended with the amplifier. The decoupling of the tubes in combination with the damping properties of the marble has the effect of reducing structure-borne noise to an absolute minimum. The tube amplifier stage is followed by a patented ultra-high impulse amplifier stage that is directly integrated into the cups of the headphones.Senheiser has used gold-vaporised ceramic electrodes in the headphones. The advantage of this design, it says, is the extremely short distance between the amplifier and the diaphragm which is less than one centimetre in the new HE1. Thus, the headphone system requires far less power for charge reversal. At a voltage of only around 5 Volt, the music signal is transmitted balanced to the high-voltage amplifier integrated into the headphones and is amplified there. This ensures extremely high impulse fidelity with relatively low power requirements. Just like the tubes of the tube amplifier, the system\\'s MOS-FET transistors have a square characteristic curve to prevent the hard distortion that occurs in amplifiers with bi-polar transistors.Sennheiser uses a new amplifier concept in a class that the audio specialist calls Cool Class A. In the low-frequency range, Cool Class A provides Class A power at any volume. In the high- and ultrahigh-frequency range, the amplifier switches from Class A to the usual Class AB operation. That will, however, only be the case when listening to a very unusual frequency spectrum.', 'The Islamic State may be planning an attack on Delhi courts around the Republic Day, sources told Mail Today quoting a fresh input by the Intelligence bureau.According to the sources, ISIS sympathisers, who have been hiding in Delhi for some time now, are planning to target courts and have done a reece of the district and the high court for a planned attack.Intelligence Bureau has shared a specific input with Delhi Police that ISIS is planning to target Delhi courts during Republic Day.Officials said that while it was earlier thought that ISIS radicals are mostly based in southern parts, recent efforts to track ISIS footprint have found that their sympathisers are also spread all over the northern India.

This is worse than the demonetisation phase,\" said Khalid, the second generation owner of the popular dhaba serving highway frequenters.RS 4,000 CRORE IN LOSSESThe accumulated losses in the last two months since the BJP manifesto promised closure of illegal slaughterhouses runs into Rs 4,000 crore, according to All India Meat and Livestock Exporters Association. Association members recently met Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow and requested him to intervene in protecting legal business and clear confusion.Four mechanised plants, which slaughter and process buffalo meat, were shut last week by district administration across UP. Two of them were in Meerut and one each in Bijnor and Saharanpur.The exporters\\' association said while the move by the government is against illegal slaughterhouses, an overzealous tribe of officers and vigilante groups have forced even legal traders to suspend operations. \"Transporting meat is a risky task nowadays and only very few vehicle-owners are ready to stick their necks out,\" said a meat trader.But numbers speak for themselves. \"UP has only 41 slaughter houses, which are certified by the Union ministry. These units contribute to 60-70 per cent of the total export of buffalo meat, worth around Rs 320 billion. The fear of closure is among the owners\\' mind, who are now being troubled by several agencies,\" Fauzan Alavi, member secretary of the exporters\\' association told MAIL TODAY.CERTIFICATION PROCESS A TEDIOUS PROCESS, SAYS SMALL SLAUGHTERHOUSESSeveral small illegal slaughterhouses that the MAIL TODAY team spoke to were united in complaining that certification process for an abattoir is a tedious process, often requiring multiple clearances at the state and central level. \"It is not feasible for a small operator to attain all the clearances,\" said one such owner, who downed shutters soon after Yogi\\'s ascension as CM.The closure of these slaughterhouses has a ripple effect on smaller units selling meat or cooked preparations. A number of small eateries and mobile food carts in Muzaffarnagar and Ghaziabad have been out of business.Chetan, a chicken shop owner at Murad Nagar in Ghaziabad, told MAIL TODAY that 20 members of his family are dependent on his shop, running for seven years. But now, uncertainty looms on them as he could be forced to look for other job. \"Police warned me to shut the shop. I have put a curtain at the entry of my shop to keep business limited only to loyal customers. I will apply for a license at the tehsil office and if I do not get it, I would think of another business like selling vegetables,\" he said.\"Taking surprise decisions is the BJP\\'s trademark,\" said owner of a food cart, Ishaan Qureshi, in Muzaffarnagar. \"First it was note ban and now meat ban. We live in an area where economy depends on unorganised sectors. Now people are losing bread and jobs.\"Meat shops and eateries in proximity with the national Capital still had an easy run as they shifted their supply route towards Delhi\\'s Ghazipur meat mandi.\"Our hotel has a daily consumption of 30-35 kg of buffalo meat that was earlier available in slaughterhouses locally. Now, we are purchasing it from Ghazipur at Rs 170-180 per kg, which is Rs 30 higher than earlier,\" said Mohammad Akhlak, owner of Shahdan Muslim Dhaba on NH 24. \"Ninety per cent of eateries have either suspended operation temporarily or raised prices.\"Akhlak said in the last one week police vigilance has been high and seizure of meat consignment always looms large during transportation.

When Hopkins handed over a large number of documents to the SFO in December 2015, BAT dismissed him as ?a rogue former employee?.The company later toned down its criticism, stating that it had appointed a team of external legal advisers to investigate the charges.The SFO?s inquiries have now become a formal investigation. In a statement it said it was ?investigating suspicions of corruption in the conduct of business by BAT, its subsidiaries and associated persons?. It invited members of the public to come forward with any evidence they might have.The news follows a major Guardian investigation revealing that BAT and other multinationals have used threats against at least eight African nations, demanding they axe or dilute the kind of tobacco control measures that have saved millions of lives in the west.BAT said it continued to conduct its own inquiries into Hopkins? charges. ?We have been cooperating with the Serious Fraud Office and British American Tobacco has been informed that the SFO has now opened a formal investigation. BAT intends to cooperate with that investigation,? it said.The company would not confirm whether the investigation concerned the allegations made by Hopkins.He has claimed he paid bribes on the company?s behalf to the Kenya Revenue Authority for access to information that BAT could use against its Kenyan competitor Mastermind. Hopkins also claimed that BAT Kenya had paid bribes to government officials in Burundi, Rwanda and Comoros to undermine tobacco control regulations.BAT hired the law firm Linklaters in February 2016 to conduct a ?full investigation? into the claims made by Hopkins. BAT later dropped Linklaters and appointed Slaughter and May as sole adviser on the case.Louis Charalambous, Hopkins? solicitor, said BAT had changed its tone. ?We note, with interest, that BAT have abandoned their earlier PR strategy of trying to shoot the messenger,? he said in a statement.?Paul Hopkins blew the whistle during his time at BAT and their internal team ignored him. Previously BAT tried to wriggle out by saying that Mr Hopkins had left their employ in acrimonious circumstances when, in fact, that was untrue. They also wrongly suggested that he had acted on his own, and portrayed themselves as the victims.?Now their new external law firm and revised PR strategy are silent about Mr Hopkins. They need to go further and set the record straight. The company cannot rewrite this history, and we look forward to seeing them answer these allegations in due course.?Hopkins said he had turned whistleblower at a cost to himself. ?I rejected an enhanced redundancy package designed to force me to sign a global confidentially agreement and just took statutory redundancy instead,? he said.Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of the campaigning charity Ash, said: ?At the time the allegations of fraud in Africa were first made against BAT the company accused the whistle blower of having a vendetta against the company and peddling falsehoods.?Eighteen months later and BAT is having to admit it?s under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.

We have decided to buy some more counting machines,? sources quoted him as saying.The bank had cut staff holidays and they were working ?round the clock? except on Sundays to count the notes.Some panel members, including Biju Janata Dal?s Bhartruhari Mahtab, Samajwadi Party?s Naresh Agarwal, flagged concern over the recent farmer agitation in Madhya Pradesh and other states, saying the farm distress was reportedly linked to the unavailability of cash in rural India following demonetisation.

We want a prime minister, who does not have 56 inch chest, but who has a 56 inch heart,\" Singh said. Talking about Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar supporting NDAs presidential nominee Ram Nath Kovind, the Congress leader said it was Kumar, who had fist pushed for the the unified oppositions candidate, although he later supported Kovind. While speaking on farmers condition in the country, Singh said demonetisation hit farmers in a big way. \"In Maharashtra, the state government announced the farm loan waiver. However, some farmers told me that the government has put a condition that farmers have to clear their outstanding loan, only after which they will get the loan waiver up to Rs 1.5 lakh,\" he said.

While the rollout day of July 1 will be known as GST Day, all the offices of the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) have been instructed to be open on Saturday as a trade facilitation measure. This was to enable the availability of officers and staff for the benefit of trade and industry, an order issued by CBEC Special Secretary and Member S Ramesh said. \"Henceforth, all field offices from the Chief Commissioners office to the Range should serve as GST Seva- Kendras for effective trade facilitation,\" it said. Apart from giving guidance to GST assessees, GST Seva Kendras should render assistance to taxpayers in migration, registration as well as filing of returns. A guidance manual for such GST Seva Kendras too has been circulated to all offices in a bid to standardise quality taxpayer services. The order instructed such manuals to be prepared for each zone operating at different levels. \"This work may be done in a time-bound manner so as to be completed in next 2-3 days,\" Ramesh wrote. CBEC also asked for strengthening of the GST Seva-Kendras to enable them discharge their functions effectively and promptly. In the run-up to the GST rollout, CBEC had organised outreach programmes and training sessions for the new regime.

', \"Snapdeal is going through tough times. Today we heard that the company cut 600 jobs and that there is a lot of confusion and chaos in its offices. Also the company founders have taken a full, which means 100 per cent, salary cut. The gravity of the situation can be ascertained from the email that Snapdeal founders have presumably written to the company employees. It has been leaked and posted on Pastebin so far now we are not completely sure that this is the complete and genuine email. But it sure seems to have come from the founders. Here is the full text:--At Snapdeal, we find ourselves at an important point in our journey - we know where we want to go and now is the time to make the choices of how we will get there.Has our company and industry been going through a troubled time? Absolutely. Did we make errors in our execution? No doubt about that. Over the last 2-3 years, with all the capital coming into this market, our entire industry, including ourselves, started making mistakes. We started growing our business much before the right economic model and market fit was figured out. We also started diversifying and starting new projects while we still hadn't perfected the first or made it profitable. We started building our team and capabilities for a much larger size of business than what was required with the present scale.Ambition is critical, because that's what motivates us to give our very best every single day - to achieve the undoable. However, a large amount of capital with ambition can be a potent mix that drives a company to defocus from its core. We feel that happened to us. We started doing too many things, and all of us starting with myself and Rohit, are to blame for it.That said, there is almost no successful company on the planet, which hasn't gone through this phase in their lifetime - Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, Lego, Spicejet, you name it! Each one of them had painted themselves into a corner many times over before they became as wildly successful as they are today. A quick look at their stock prices over the last 15 years will show you what we're talking about. The formula to revive the company is uncannily similar for almost all of them - focus on only your core, stop all non-core activities, reduce costs drastically, turn profitable as soon as you can, and use those profits to spur further growth and new projects. We must do the same, and there is no doubt that with the really smart folks we have in the company, we will make it something that we are all very proud of.This also comes with some tough decisions in the short term. As part of our overall path to profitability plan that is currently in full swing, we will be reorganizing the company into a lean, focused, and entrepreneurial one. We are combining teams, reducing layers, eliminating non-core projects and strengthening the focus on profitable growth. Sadly, we will also be saying really painful goodbyes to some of our colleagues in this process. This is by far the hardest decision that we have ever taken in our lives. Our colleagues are our friends before they are co-workers, and I feel a deep sense of disappointment that we won't be able to have them continue on this journey with us. We will do what we can to help them with their transition to their next opportunity. We take this time to express our sincere gratitude to all those who are leaving us -your contributions have helped build Snapdeal in ways big and small. With time, I am confident, that we will be able to welcome back some of our colleagues who will be leaving us at this point. And that point, we will be a self sufficient, profitable company.Daunting as it may appear in the moment, it is important that we do this now, so that we can continue on our overall mission of building a successful, profitable business that provides incredible opportunities to our customers, sellers and partners. This also means more responsibility for the team members continuing on this journey with us.We believe that every resource of the company should be deployed for driving us towards profitable growth and with this announcement, both Rohit and I are taking a 100% salary cut. Many of our leaders have also stepped up proactively and offered to take a significant cut in their compensation, which is an excellent sign of how galvanised the team feels in this shared quest for profitability.These are tough times, no doubt. But, I am supremely confident, that like we have done before as a team, we will prevail. The greatest companies in the world got built in many interesting patterns - we just can't tell the pattern while are in the midst of it. For now, we need to keep our heads down, focus all our energy on execution that delivers on our two focus areas - best customer and seller experience, and profitable growth. This will mean tough choices and a conscious departure from a me-too race to the edge of the cliff. Let's remember - GMV is vanity, Profit is sanity.I have seen that whenever we put our minds to a well-defined plan, which we believe in unequivocally, we make progress like nobody else can. I am glad that we have picked our path clearly - of building a profitable business over the next two years.\", 'As the nation remembers its brave heroes on the occasion of Kargil Vijay Diwas, HT takes a look at how the war unfolded in 1999.Indian and Pakistani armies fought the war in May-July 1999 in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere along the Line of Control (LoC).India launched ?Operation Vijay? to clear the Kargil sector of infiltration by the Pakistani soldiers and Kashmiri militants on the Indian side of the Line of Control.Kargil was the first televised war viewed extensively by the country.Here is how the war unfolded:1999: The warMay 4: Reports of infiltrators atop heights of Kargil.

The clarification by Minister of State for Defence Subhash Bhamre came in the Lok Sabha in response to a question. \"No proposal for scrapping the Sahayak system, presently in place in the Army, is under consideration in the Ministry at present,\" he said, in a brief written reply. Under the Sahayak or buddy system, a solider is attached to officers and their duties include protecting the officers, maintaining their weapons and equipment and helping them in carrying out their responsibilities.

Earlier this year, a number of videos had surfaced where some army jawans were seen voicing their anger over the Sahayak system with some even alleging that they are treated as servants by the officers whom they are attached to.

Among the hardest-hit regions was Sardinia, which is seeking natural disaster status.Farmers? lobby Coldiretti last week estimated ?2bn ($2.3bn) worth of damage had been done to Italian agriculture so far.

Last week, the governor of Lazio region, which includes the Italian capital, ordered that no more water be drawn from Lake Bracciano, which supplies some of the Italian capital, because the drastically decreasing water level posed danger to the aquatic life of the lake.The lake, 40km from Rome, used to be used only for backup water supply but recent years have seen it being tapped on a regular basis.Rome water company ACEA warned that without the lake, drastic rationing loomed. Italian media said staggered water supply shutdowns could last as long as eight hours daily in alternating neighbourhoods and start as soon as Wednesday. Rome?s famed fountains risk being turned off.The move put populist 5-Star Movement Mayor Virginia Raggi under pressure, since the city of Rome is a major shareholder in Acea. Michele Meta, a Democratic party lawmaker from Rome, demanded to know why Acea ?doesn?t have other solutions besides rationing and staggering the capital?s water? supply?Rome had 26 rainy days in this year?s first six months, compared to 88 in the first half of 2016, with precipitation totals in those same periods more than four times higher last year than this year.But water supply pipelines in the Rome area ? famed in ancient Roman times for its aqueducts, segments of which still stand ? are notoriously leaky.La Stampa daily reported on Sunday that water, energy and environment companies lobby Utilitalia analysed companies serving roughly half of Italy?s population and concluded that the water loss rate from inadequate infrastructure, often decades-old, ranged from 26% in the north to 46% in the central and southern parts of the country.', 'After Uttar Pradesh\\'s anti-romeo squads, another BJP ruled state, Rajasthan, has launched mobile patrolling units to prevent molestation, harassment or eve teasing against women in the state.Â\\xa026 women patrolling units, each comprising of two female constables, were flagged off from the Jaipur Commissionerate on Monday, for deployment in sensitive areas where instances of eve teasing, harassment have occurred in the past.\"52 girls are there in these first efforts of ours whom we have trained who will be operating in 26 teams.

The complainants say that some singers are not just promoting animal cruelty, but drugs consumption and use of illegal firearms through their explicit videos, as well.The AWBI has taken cognizance of these complaints and written letters to Punjab Police for action. Strangely, singer Kamal Grewal responded to one of these FB posts saying, \"How can a song, which is itself named \\'Sarkari Ban\\' be banned by the authorities.\" Diljit Dosanjh, on the other hand, did not respond to the criticism on FB despite being tagged.Earlier, Union minister for women and child welfare Maneka Gandhi had said that she was aware of this cruel sport. \"Dogs are starved for days.

No one will be allowed to take law into their hands,? he said.Ajgaonkar was responding to a question tabled by Congress legislator Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco.In May this year, police in the tourist state had asked its personnel to arrest people found drinking in public places. At a meeting held in Calangute that month, citizens had complained about drinking on beaches as well other public places and no action being taken against them.Meanwhile, replying to another question, the state on Tuesday refused to withdraw the contract signed with the lifeguard agency to man the beaches, claiming that the government could not run such services.?The state government used to run lifeguard services in the past.

Thackeray was speaking at the inauguration of the newly refurbished Mahakavi Kalidas Natyamandir arts theatre at Mulund. Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, however, gave the function a miss, highlighting the strained relations between the allies. Speaking at the function, Uddhav Thackeray said what could the BMC do if it rained heavily.He said that the city didn?t witness much water logging this year so far and expressed confidence that Mumbai would not get submerged. ?But then what would the BMC do if it rains heavily?? he said. Meanwhile, the BJP leaders who boycotted the event said that they had written to mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar to invite chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for the event, which the corporation failed to. Corporators also said that the municipal commissioner had initiated an inquiry into the functioning of the theatre. The Priyadarshini sports complex, where the theatre stands, was handed over to the trust Brihanmumbai Krida and Lalitkala Pratisthan (BKLP) on a 30-year lease in 1990. BKLP is headed by Shiv Sena leader Aadesh Bandekar. Local BJP corporator Prakash Gangadhare has accused the trust of financial irregularities and illegal activities. Gangadhare said, ?The municipal commissioner has already ordered an inquiry into the irregularities. We opposed it because the mayor failed to invite the chief minister for the inauguration.?Ironically, T ward of Mulund is represented only by BJP leaders at the corporation, the state legislature and even the Parliament.

', 'He studied agriculture in rural England and was tipped by some as China?s future leader.But on Tuesday morning Sun Zhengcai?s political obituary was splashed across the front page of the Communist party?s official mouthpiece in a damning editorial entitled: ?Rule strictly over the party with iron discipline.??The investigation into comrade Sun Zhengcai sounds the alarm bell for the party,? the People?s Daily article warned, as it announced that the youngest member of China?s political elite had been ejected from power for a ?serious violation of discipline?.?Top cadres must hold firm political positions, temper their political characters ? and act in a manner consistent with the party?s central committee with [president] Xi Jinping as its core,? the broadsheet declared. Just a few weeks ago, Sun, a 53-year-old former agriculture minister who studied farming at Hertfordshire?s Rothamstad research centre in the 1990s, was the high-flying party chief of one of the world?s fastest-growing cities, the sweltering Yangtze port of Chongqing.Many believed he was being groomed for greatness and would use that job ? handed to him in late 2012 after the sensational downfall of flamboyant party leader Bo Xilai ? as a springboard from which to leap into one of seven highly-coveted spots on China?s top ruling body, the politburo standing committee. Places on that elite council will be up for grabs later this year when Chinese leaders flock to Beijing for their quinquennial enclave, the 19th Communist party congress.Such a promotion would likely have put Sun ? part of the so-called sixth generation of post-revolution leaders ? in line to succeed either Xi or premier Li Keqiang at the next party congress in 2022.But Xi?s unforeseen decision to purge Sun has shredded not only those expectations but also the playbook governing how one-party China conducts political leadership successions. In doing so, some experts fear Xi may also have set in motion a new phase of political turbulence in the world?s number two economy.?A smooth leadership transition is really crucial to the survival of Chinese Communist party rule in China and this really throws a monkey wrench into the machine,? said Susan Shirk, a US expert in elite Chinese politics who was deputy assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton.Shirk said that for almost two decades China?s rulers had abided by an unofficial succession system designed to prevent both cut-throat and destabilising internecine power struggles and the rise of strongman dictators who could cling to power until they died or were violently overthrown.According to those unwritten rules, presumptive heirs to the Communist party?s top two jobs, general secretary and premier, should be informally anointed five years ahead of a full leadership transition, as had happened with Xi and Li in 2007. Some had seen Sun as one of those two likely heirs ? the other was Guangdong party chief Hu Chunhua, who remains in power ? and the decision to bring him down now brought ?intense uncertainty about how the game will be played in the future?, Shirk said. ?I think that has got to make the people at the top ranks of the Chinese communist party very uneasy about the risks that presents.?As with much about Chinese politics, the exact nature of Sun?s alleged crimes remains murky, as does the political rationale behind his defenestration.The first hint of his undoing came when one of Xi?s feared corruption-busting teams descended on Chongqing late last year. In its subsequent report the group accused his administration of failing to eliminate the poisonous and pernicious ?ideological legacy? of Bo Xilai, a bitter Xi rival, who had been ousted five years earlier after the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood sparked China?s biggest political scandal in decades. Then, in mid-July, came the unexpected and unexplained announcement that Sun had been replaced by a Xi loyalist who vowed to purify the city?s ?political ecosystem?. Sun is rumoured to have been taken into custody while attending a conference in Beijing.Cheng Li, the director of the Brookings Institute?s China Center, said it was unclear if Sun was facing accusations of corruption or political offences such as conspiring against Xi: ?It could be either ? or both.?Many believe Xi, who some suspect hopes to stay in power beyond 2022, viewed Sun as a power-hungry competitor who had to be eliminated. Li, an authority on the Communist party?s elite, said that even before the purge: ?I have talked to many people who know Sun [and they said] ? ?That guy has a very strong personal ambition; you simply cannot believe what he says and what he promises?.?In Chinese, you use the term ?yÃ³u? [slippery or cunning].?Bill Bishop, the publisher of the influential Sinocism newsletter, said Sun?s demise was further proof that Xi ? who took power in 2012 and has been called China?s most dominant leader since Mao ? was a masterful and steely political strategist.As he sought to cement his status as China?s omnipotent ?Chairman of Everything?, Xi was using anti-corruption investigators to pick off rivals, who were replaced with supporters. Sun?s successor in Chongqing, Chen Min?er, who worked under Xi during his five years as Zhejiang province?s party boss, now appears poised to claim a seat at the party?s top table at this autumn?s congress.?Xi certainly looks like he would make Machiavelli ? and Mao ? quite proud,? Bishop said.Shirk, the chair of the 21st Century China Centre at the University of California, San Diego, said she saw Sun?s downfall not as as sign of Xi?s strength, but of the fragility of China?s political system. ?If [Xi] upturns the smooth succession now, I think he?s setting himself up for trouble, for some pushback from the rest of the party elite.?If they feel they are being put at risk and the whole party is being put at risk by a leader who is trying to claim too much of the power and privilege for himself, then I think there is a risk.?I?m not saying it is necessarily an elite coup or something like that, but it could be.?For Sun Zhengcai, there is little doubt what now lies ahead.?He?ll end up in jail,? said Li.Additional reporting by Wang Zhen', 'Chandigarh, Apr 18 (PTI) The Haryana government today decided to provide accidental insurance cover to all residents of the state in the age group of 18 to 70 years.

Mehbooba said.Mufti  has  earlier blamed Pakistan for the unrest in the state, but this is for the first time she pointed  the finger at China. The allegation comes amid  a  standoff between Indian and Chinese forces in Doklam at the Sikkim border. Militants have stepped up attacks in recent months on government forces in the state as counter-insurgency operations intensify. Mufti?s meeting with the home minister in the national capital in the wake of the attack on Amarnath pilgrims on July 10, in which seven persons died, lasted for almost an hour after it commenced at 11.30am. She termed the attack a conspiracy to whip up communal tension in the state?Ensuring security of Amarnath Yatra obviously topped the agenda of the meeting,? said an aide to the home minister. Their meeting also came a day after the home minister briefed top opposition leaders on the situation in the valley and steps taken to ensure better security for the Amarnath pilgrims. The opposition has slammed the government for failing to ensure security of Amarnath Yatris. The home ministry in consultation with the state government has decided to erect 21 more security pickets on the Amarnath route to check whether any vehicle carrying pilgrims is moving beyond the deadline of 7pm in the Valley. The ill-fated bus that came under attack in the state?s Anantnag district had violated the deadline.

Narendra Singh Bundela, joint commissioner of police (traffic), said on Thursday that the five cops were caught taking bribes from the truckers over the past three days. He confirmed that departmental action has been initiated against the accused traffic cops.  They were allegedly stopping truck drivers on Delhi?s border points and extorting money from them by asking them to prove whether GST has been paid on the goods that they were carrying or not.  Bundela clarified that no traffic policeman was authorised to check GST receipts. He urged the people  to immediately report such cases as ?many more similar complaints have been received?.?People should reach us on Twitter, Facebook, our helpline numbers, emails or whatever platform they find convenient. We have instructed the traffic DCPs of all regions to review the situation and conduct surprise checks,? said Bundela.An assistant sub-inspector, a head constable and three constables were among the suspended cops.A senior police officer said the action on such cases is being directly monitored by the police commissioner, Amulya Patnaik, and Ajay Kashyap, Special Commissioner (Traffic).The Goods and Services Tax was rolled out on July 1, ushering a new system of indirect taxes in the country. It is meant to boost growth and scrap local taxes that add to overhead costs and stymie businesses.The traffic police have also been receiving frequent complaints from the city?s traders. On Thursday, a group of traders representing Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) met Ajay Kashyap, Special CP (traffic), and demanded action.?Traders have been complaining that tempo and other commercial vehicles are being stopped by traffic policemen who are demanding to see the GST bills and invoices of the goods being transported. This is being used as an excuse to seek money from them,? said Brijesh Goyal, CTI convenor, adding the traffic police were not authorised to check the GST bills.', 'Not enough respect.

Mujhe toh sirf gana tha (all I had to do was sing). After my father?s untimely death, I was the sole bread-winner of the family. I had no time to think of anything except how to look after my siblings. The only thing I could do was sing. So I sang. I?d leave early in the morning and commute by train(in Mumbai) from studio to studio, meeting music directors hoping to get work,? recalls Lata tai.All that changed in 1947, when the voice of Lata Mangeshkar exploded in India cinema, wiping away all other singing prototypes.The Nightingale recalls those heady days of initial success with sheer gratitude. ?I think in 1949, I sang around 100-120 songs. The majority of them, from films like Mehboob?s Andaz and Raj Kapoor?s Barsaat, were big hits. In 1949, I had 40-50 chartbusters, including Hawaa mein udta jaye, Jiya beqaraar hai (Barsaat); Aayega aanewala (Mahal); Lara lapaa (Ek Thi Ladki); Chup chup khade ho (Badi Bahen); and Sajan ki galiyan chhod chale (Lahore).?She recalls her relationship with female leads with much fondness: ?During those days, playback singers were called ?ghost voices?, because we really were like ghosts... totally invisible to the public. Even my name was not printed on the records; it was the name of the character that the heroine played that was printed on the record. For the song Ayega aanewala, for Mahal, the name on the record was ?Kamini?, which was [actor] Madhubala?s name in the film.?In the industry, however, Lata Mangeshkar was the name everyone wanted.

Some of these actors, like Madhubala, even put this in their contract.Lataji says, ?What you have heard is true. But I never thought of my voice as being bigger than the film. I sang my songs keeping the heroine?s personality in mind. There was no desire to be heard beyond the screen.

Last year, 96 reports of children being sexually exploited in internet imagery were reported in India - a rise of 140 per cent from 2014, according to National Crimes Records Bureau data. \"IT ministry has approved a formal agreement wherein Department of Telecommunications will obtain list maintained by INTERPOL containing domain names hosting child sexual abuse contents and act as an appropriate agency of the government to direct its licensee ISPs to expeditiously remove or disable access to material found in violation of the IT Act,\" the Centre said in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court. \"Further the mechanism to obtain the list containing domain names hosting contents of child sexual abuse is being worked out in consultation with the CBI.\" The top court asked the Centre in February to suggest ways to ban child pornography in all forms in the country saying that the nation cannot \"afford to carry on any experiment\" in the name of \"liberty or freedom of speech and expression\".

Interpol is a major source of getting access to such lists of websites containing child sexual abuse. The agency maintains a regular update of the \"worst\" of such sites. Interpol has been tasked by the UN General Assembly in 2009 to maintain and disseminate to the national central bureaus a worldwide list of URLs, which contains these websites that publish the most severe child abuse material.

His interrogation led to the recovery of the severed head of Sonam, one of the two women whose decapitated body was pulled out from a sewer on the ground floor of a Munirka building on November 25. Sonam?s head was recovered from another sewer located barely 10 meters away from the building. The head, with scanty skin cover remaining, was stuck inside the vent pipe, police said. Ironically, the police had searched that sewer twice for the missing head after the recovery of Sonam?s body. But the head could not be recovered, as it was stuck inside the plumbing vent. The police had checked only waste-in and waste-out pipes. Read |Delhi cops hunt for 4 suspects in brutal murders of sex workersSenior police officers said they initially did not believe Thapa?s claims that he had dumped Sonam?s head in the sewer through its manhole. It was only when Thapa maintained his claim despite sustained interrogation that the police searched the sewer again and found a third duct where the head was stuck. Thapa?s live-in partner, Mini Sangam aka Neha from Meghalaya, and their cook Jeevan from Nepal, were arrested on December 10 for allegedly killing two freelance spa therapists, Sushma alias Sonam from Assam and Nayesha from Nepal on November 16 and 17. The fourth accused, Govind, continues to be at large. Police were hunting for the duo in areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh bordering Nepal, after they learnt that their last location was in Nepal. RP Upadhyay, joint commissioner of police (southeastern range), said that Thapa?s arrest was crucial in the case as he was the main conspirator and only he could tell the exact motive behind the two gruesome murders. A love triangle between Arjun, Neha and Sonam, Arjun?s greed for money, and a possible sex racket merged to make a compelling motive in the murder of Sonam and Nayesha. Arjun owed Rs 3 lakh each to Sonam and Nayesha but was not returning it to them, said police.Read |Love triangle, sex ring, money behind chopped bodies found in Delhi?s MunirkaManishi Chandra, additional DCP (south), said that interrogation of Neha and Jeevan revealed that Arjun had hideouts, not only in Delhi but also in other states, where he had associates and facilitators.

However they left the building within 10 minutes, said the witness. ?We only knew that they drove a Swift Desire,? said inspector Santosh Kamble from Tilak Nagar police station.A team of three officers were then assigned to investigate the series of house break-ins. The officers, including PI Avinash Pore and PSI Amol Ambawane, found that the car that the robbers used had a number plate of a bullet bike from Meerut. The informers told the officers that this gang was from Meerut and travelled by car from Uttar Pradesh to Mumbai. The gang would stop on the way to Mumbai and break in to houses. ?The Meerut gang only chose two- or three-storey  houses for a quick escape,? said Shahaji Umap, deputy commissioner of police (zone VI). After finding out that the men had rented an apartment in Mumbra, the police team searched the house to find their clothes and other belongings. ?The five had rented an expensive apartment, saying that they were engineers and had to travel a lot. They did so to avoid staying at lodges and hotels,? added Umap. The team then left for UP on July 5 where they traced the five people who stayed in Meerut and Bulandshahr.

He would be visiting Kiev in August, he told his caller. ?I look forward to visiting with the president and getting a more in-depth briefing ? If that?s the result, then he?s going to be a very, very wealthy and successful man.?Krasnov and Stolyarov are sometimes called the ?Jerky Boys of Russia?, named after an American duo who put out recordings of their prank phone calls in the 1990s.

Here is our Running Shaadi movie review.Running Shaadi Cast: Amit Sadh, Taapsee Pannu, Arsh BajwaRunning Shaadi Direction: Amit RoyRunning Shaadi Rating: (3/5)Running Shaadi, previously known as Runningshaadi.com but not anymore because Shaadi.com approached Bombay High Court protesting against the title, is a film that is great in patches but is mostly just about okay.The story of Running Shaadi involves Ram Bharose (Amit Sadh) and Nimmi (Taapsee Pannu), a boy and girl who grow up together in Punjab and after a fallout with his boss, Ram joins hands with his friend 'Cyberjeet' (the excellent Arsh Bajwa) to start a website called Runningshaadi.com that organises all that an everyday eloping couple from India would need. Nimmi joins the duo but soon enough, the romantic tension between her and Ram takes the story through unexpected turns.MOVIE REVIEW: THE GHAZI ATTACKWatch Running Shaadi trailer here:Running Shaadi was ready two years ago, but the distributors could never find a suitable window to release it. That is unfortunate because within those two years, films like Dolly Ki Doli and Happy Bhag Jayegi released. As such, conceptually, the film seems dated. While watching the film, you would get shades of Band Baaja Baaraat (two unlikely small-towners getting together to become entrepreneurs), and of course, the aforementioned films because there's the entire 'runaway bride' angle.Nevertheless, there is a lot that works for Running Shaadi. And that 'lot' is pretty much the excellent casting.Amit Sadh as the ambitious and resourceful Ram Bharose gives a career-defining performance as the lead. He is what they call 'lambi race ka ghoda.' Amit gets to showcase a range of emotions in Running Shaadi and he never, ever falters. He is so good. Hopefully, he gets noticed in Running Shaadi for all his worth.Then, there's Arsh Bajwa as the goofy but smart tech geek Sarabjeet AKA Cyberjeet. The scenes of him worshipping Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg and that funny-for-a-while red turban with the image of a Facebook 'Like' button on it seem forced but that does not take away from Arsh's grade-A supporting act.Taapsee Pannu gets a very tricky, complicated character, Nimmi. Nimmi is the kind of girl who you will never want to make a team-member if you have to rob a bank. She cons Ram Bharose in the most unexpected manner right before the interval and one will be hard-pressed to sympathise or empathise with her. However, Ram, who has been established as a 'sorted' dude, for some reason, continues to willingly jump into near-fatal situations for her. Is love a good enough reason to justify unconvincing character development?Watch 'Mannerless Majnu' from Running Shaadi:Three entire paragraphs are devoted to the film's actors because that is how much they hold the story together. Because without them, the plot falls apart. Running Shaadi is made of an err...running chain of unbelievable plot twists but we will suspend our disbelief simply because of the strength of its actors.Debutant director Amit Roy, who has previously been a cinematographer for Ram Gopal Varma's very uniquely-shot movies such as the Sarkar films, Nishabd and Rann, has the potential to make a great second film. Running Shaadi on paper seems trite, but it is consistently engaging because newer and wilder plot developments get thrown at you (Roy is also the writer) and you cannot help but continue to run with its characters to find out what eventually becomes of them.In a week packed with multiple Bollywood and Hollywood releases, will Running Shaadi get noticed, more so, by the right people?

Police said the girl was impregnated by the 51-year-old neighbour, who raped her eight times in as many months. The auto driver was arrested on Friday after a case under sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against him at the Mukherjee Nagar police station. The man, identified as Abdul Gaffar, allegedly admitted to his crime. He claimed said he would pay her Rs 500 to Rs 800 every time he raped her.

She had been suffering from stomach pain for the past few days.Gaffar had given her abortion pills after he learnt she was pregnant, police said. A police officer said the girl was writing an exam in the school when she developed labour pain. When she complained of stomach pain, the teacher asked her to go to the washroom. Minutes later, the girl delivered a baby girl in the washroom. The school administration informed the girl?s parents, who had no clue how she became pregnant. The authorities rushed the girl and her premature baby to a nearby hospital for medical attention.Milind Dumbre, deputy commissioner of police (northwest), said the condition of the girl and her daughter was out of danger and stable. After the girl gained consciousness, she narrated her ordeal to the police.

Why must we? Because not only does cotton keep one cool in the summer, it also gives a big boost to Indian handloom and livelihood to weavers.So, we give you four solid reasons to ditch all other fabrics in the cruel Indian summer and wear cotton everyday:1. It keeps you cool in summers and warm in winters: Basically, cotton provides thermal insulation because the fabric traps air between fibres. Cotton fibres also keep the fabric away from the skin, letting even more air pass through, which helps with insulation.\", '198 Anderson & Root Eng v Ind, Trent Bridge, 2014163 Agar & Hughes Aus v Eng, Trent Bridge, 2013151 Collinge & Hastings NZ v Pak, Auckland, 1973143 Best & Ramdin WI v Eng, Edgbaston, 2012133 Bari & Raja Pak v WI, Bridgetown, 1977133 Khan & Tendulkar Ind v Bang, Dhaka, 2004130 Foster & Rhodes Eng v Aus, Sydney, 1903128 Higgs & Snow Eng v WI, The Oval, 1966137 Mailey & Taylor Aus v Eng, Sydney, 1924?

She says she was duped into accepting a post that summarily broke her home. A marriage of 15 years was dissolved in minutes unilaterally with her husband dispatching a \\'talaqnama\\' to her while she was at her parent\\'s place in Kashipur, Uttarakhand recuperating from an illness. Shaira recounts, \"I spoke to him over the phone last year where he said he had left me. Then one day he said he was sending some property papers and that I must accept the post. I did. And when I opened it, there lay before me a divorce deed (talaqnama).\"Shaira alleges she went through a harrowing time in the last 15 years of marriage. She was mentally tortured by demands of dowry initially. After she had two children, all subsequent pregnancies were forcefully aborted by her husband. Despite all this, she never protested, just so that she could save her home and not bring disrepute to her family.\\'KHULA\\' DIVORCEWhen I asked her mother about why she let her daughter suffer and not demand a \\'khula\\', a divorce initiated by a woman, her mother claimed she were unaware of her daughter\\'s plight. Shaira\\'s mother, Firoza Bano, however later confessed that the family wanted to save the marriage from breaking somehow as they feared disrepute. She said, \"Since day one he (Shaira\\'s husband) would say I will seek talaq but we are simple people and wanted our daughter to remain settled in the marriage.\"Though Shaira has an MA in Sociology she has never worked. She was always financially dependent on her husband, who offered her a paltry \\'meher\\' amount of about 16,000 rupees at the time of talaq. It is this \\'unfairness\\' she says she has challenged but with this she has taken on those who refuse to entertain any thought of change to the Muslim personal laws. FIGHT AGAINST TRADITIONSHer brother Arshad told us \"The Muslim Personal Law Board has filed a petition against us saying we are going against the rules of Islam and they will not allow any change.\"Member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Kamal Farooqi told us that the Board has filed a rejoinder to Shaira\\'s petition.

This is unacceptable.\"The AIMPLB is not alone in its opposition. No political party is willing to push for changes in personal laws. So much so that even the BJP that has been vocal on uniform civil code skirted the issue.

Mallya has been in the UK for months, escaping arrest warrants against him, while a court in London is also hearing a case regarding his return to India. Modi today met May during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit here and sought UKs help in this regard. Both leaders also talked about the complete range of India-UK ties. In a tweet after the meeting, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Gopal Baglay said the Prime Minister asked for UKs \"cooperation for return of escaped Indian economic offenders\". On economic offenders issue, Baglay said, \"you have seen our tweet\". On whether cooperation from the UK was sought with just Mallya in mind, he said, \"The tweet mentions economic offenders who have escaped from India and that is the answer\". To a query on whether was Mallya in focus in terms of escaped economic offenders discussed with May, Baglay said, \"We have put out a tweet and the term used there is a plural... its English language and people who know English should understand it\". Asked whether all on the list were discussed and no specific names were mentioned, he said, \"I wont like to go into that and what we have said in the tweet is what our position is\". Baglay refused to comment directly on any question related to Mallya. Mallya, who is wanted in India for Kingfisher Airlines default on loans worth nearly Rs 9,000 crore, has been in the UK since March 2016. In April, he had attended a central London police station for his arrest and was released on conditional bail a few hours later after providing a bail bond worth 650,000 pounds, assuring the court of abiding by all conditions associated with extradition proceedings, such as surrender of his passport and a ban on him possessing any travel documents. Lalit Modi, former chief of Indian Premier League (IPL), is wanted by the Indian authorities with respect to a money laundering probe and he is said to be in the UK. The former cricket administrator has maintained that he has not done any wrong in any of the IPL deals. ', 'The Guardian was wrong to report in January that the popular messaging service WhatsApp had a security flaw so serious that it was a huge threat to freedom of speech.But it was right to bring to wide public notice an aspect of WhatsApp that had the potential to make some messages vulnerable to being read by an unintended recipient.The Guardian did not test with an appropriate range of experts a claim that had implications for the more than one billion people who use the Facebook-owned WhatsApp.In a detailed review I found that misinterpretations, mistakes and misunderstandings happened at several stages of the reporting and editing process. Cumulatively they produced an article that overstated its case.The Guardian ought to have responded more effectively to the strong criticism the article generated from well-credentialled experts in the arcane field of developing and adapting end-to-end encryption for a large-scale messaging service.The original article ? now amended and associated with the conclusions of this review ? led to follow-up coverage, some of which sustained the wrong impression given at the outset. The most serious inaccuracy was a claim that WhatsApp had a ?backdoor?, an intentional, secret way for third parties to read supposedly private messages. This claim was withdrawn within eight hours of initial publication online, but withdrawn incompletely. The story retained material predicated on the existence of a backdoor, including strongly expressed concerns about threats to freedom, betrayal of trust and benefits for governments which surveil. In effect, having dialled back the cause for alarm, the Guardian failed to dial back expressions of alarm.This made a relatively small, expert, vocal and persistent audience very angry. Guardian editors did not react to an open letter co-signed by 72 experts in a way commensurate with the combined stature of the critics and the huge number of people potentially affected by the story. The essence of the open letter and a hyperlink to it were added to the article, but wider consultation and a fundamental reconsideration of the story were needed.The aspect of WhatsApp at the heart of this matter, put very simply, is as follows. When a user of WhatsApp is offline, any messages at that time in transit to him or her are held in Facebook?s servers. (If unclaimed after 30 days they are deleted, Facebook advised.) If, while offline, the recipient registers a new device, any messages waiting for the person on Facebook?s servers are no longer deliverable because they are encrypted for the person?s old device. To prevent those messages from being lost, when the intended recipient comes back online, any in-transit messages are re-encrypted with the new device?s key and resent automatically. If senders have turned on a notification setting in WhatsApp on their phone, they are told that the key has changed, but not otherwise.Critics said that the Guardian article overstated the risk of what is known in the jargon as a man-in-the-middle attack, in which a third party could exploit the combination of offline phone, messages in transit and changed key to intercept private communications.The intensity of the external criticism seems to have stemmed partly from frustration that the article was in the Guardian, with its deserved reputation for using and reporting on technology in ways that help bridge the gap between non-experts and specialists.Some were concerned that an overstated claim in the Guardian about risk to the security of WhatsApp would cause non-expert users to become unduly worried and needlessly abandon WhatsApp for less secure communication methods.The critics had two different groups of WhatsApp users in mind.First, the vast majority of users, for whom WhatsApp security is fine and who would probably experience worse communications security if they stopped using it.Second, a much smaller group, activists in authoritarian regimes, whose threat model means they need high security and for whom the popularity of WhatsApp means they can ?blend into the crowd?. This group could be at serious risk if they abandoned WhatsApp for something less secure, or perhaps even for a service more secure but used by relatively few, because that might attract the authorities? attention.A related concern was that authoritarian governments could exploit the Guardian story to move against the use of encrypted messaging.During the review I independently confirmed that a Turkish government official had used the article when, in effect, attempting to deter users from WhatsApp. It was also confirmed that some activists who had been in the process of switching from a less secure messaging service to WhatsApp became confused by the Guardian story. On available evidence, I am unable to conclude whether these effects were widespread. But one case is one too many.I am not an expert in this field. For the review I consulted suitably experienced experts other than the 72 who had already declared their view.I found a consensus that in practice, as WhatsApp is presently understood, it would be very difficult to use this aspect of WhatsApp for systematic targeted surveillance. Experts described challenges with timing, targeting and concealment which they said would be formidable even for a major private or public actor with access to Facebook servers.Experts were unanimous that it is not a backdoor. ?Vulnerability? is a contested term, acceptable in this context to some but not all. One called it a ?weakness?, others a ?trade-off?.One expert called WhatsApp ?pretty excellent security against broad surveillance and that is valuable?. Another said the trade-off was reasonable. A third said: ?This product is safe for the majority of people.?I conveyed to Facebook one specialist?s proposal that the relevant notification setting should be default opt-out, not default opt-in, so that although in-transit messages would continue to be resent automatically, at least senders would be informed that it had happened unless they turned the notification setting off. Facebook replied: ?Yes, WhatsApp considered this but decided against it when considering how it might be interpreted by the average user, who may be using a smartphone for the first time. Instead we chose to make this option available to those wanting an extra layer of security on their accounts.?Experts confirmed that weighing these kinds of considerations about user behaviour is normal when designers are deciding the balance between security and usability in a mass-market service like WhatsApp. The experts confirmed the gist of the responses to the core Guardian article blogged on the day of its publication by two leading figures in developing WhatsApp, Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton.Several independent experts agreed with this part of the open letter?s criticism when it was read to them:?It?s important to recognize the tendency of many security researchers, especially inexperienced ones, to overestimate the practical impact of vulnerabilities they find, and being ignorant how security needs play out in the real world, the massive amount of work on actual user behavior in the face of friction and warnings, and the need for independent verification and context.?I accept the consensus view of the experts and, in consultation with editors, have arranged for the coverage to be amended and for a note to be added drawing attention to the review and linking to this column.I do not agree with critics that the story should be entirely retracted. After all the surrounding controversy, the story?s complete disappearance would be odd. More importantly, there is a clear public interest in the Guardian preserving (with appropriate amendments) reporting on this aspect of WhatsApp and the inherent trade-off. With so many users, watchfulness, news, analysis and debate about the security of WhatsApp are important. Communications privacy is a key element of human rights in the digital era, and developments affecting it ought to be reported. Also, Facebook needs scrutiny, both generally due to its power and specifically in its management of WhatsApp.Facebook?s plan last year to share within its group of companies WhatsApp users? personal information caused controversy and appeared to breach prior commitments. Regulators stepped in, including in the UK. At least one court has upheld a regulator?s intervention.As one expert noted, Facebook?s servers are a black box. It is not possible for outsiders to verify exactly what happens when messages pass through Facebook?s servers on their way to and from WhatsApp users. Trust is required. Given Facebook?s record, steady scrutiny is the right stance.We learned from Edward Snowden?s disclosures that large service providers which handle the communications of millions of people have been compromised in the past. Sections of a research paper published in March 2017 provide a more recent review of encryption workarounds.The UK home secretary, Amber Rudd, has wondered aloud whether service providers should continue to be able lawfully to deny to government authorities access to encrypted messaging. Measures affecting the security of encrypted messaging seem likely to be among new anti-terrorism proposals.I found a consistent view among experts that Facebook could do more to make non-expert users aware of the trade-off and educate them about how to assess their own threat model.Since the Guardian article, WhatsApp has been better secured by the introduction of optional two-factor verification in February. That process was being tested in November 2016 and had been reported in a specialist blog in July 2016, so the Guardian coverage did not prompt the improvement. We will probably never know whether it spurred Facebook to accelerate the process.', 'Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched Swachh Bharat campaign with much fanfare and lots of emotion asking every citizen to contribute towards making India absolutely clean by 2019 - the 150th birth year of Mahatma Gandhi. But, BJP MP from Barabanki Priyanka Rawat seems to be least bothered.On an inspection of an embankment on the Saryu - which passes through Ayodhya and finds mention in Vedas as wells the Ramayana - Priyanka Rawat tossed a plastic water bottle into the river.Ironically, UP Water Resources Minister Dharampal Singh accompanied him when she tossed the plastic bottle into the Saryu. Dharampal Singh, incidentally, gave a speech on how to keep rivers clean. He emphasised, in his speech, that keeping rivers clean was a necessity.Dharampal Singh and Priyanka Rawat had travelled more than 100 kilometres to Gonda from Lucknow for Saryu embankment inspection. The officials present at the site suggested that Priyanka Rawat and Dharampal Singh take a round of Saryu river in a motorboat.AS IT HAPPENEDPriyanka Rawat can be seen in the video boarding the boat holding a plastic water bottle and carelessly tossing it up into the river. The camera crew present there shot the entire incident. Priyanka Rawat was the first to get onto the boat. Minister Dharampal Singh followed her. After gulping the remaining water from the bottle, Priyanka reportedly asked the minister what to do with the bottle.Without waiting for the answer from the Minister, Priyanka Rawat looks around and tosses up the bottle into Saryu river. #WATCH Priyanka Rawat, BJP MP from Barabanki tosses a plastic bottle into River Saryu, in Gonda pic.twitter.com/XBXGI2DNx3MINISTER BATS FOR CLEANLINESSA little later, Minister Dharampal Singh addresses the media and blames the previous Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav governments for the state of rivers in Uttar Pradesh.

Thae Yong-ho defected to South Korea in August last year and since December has been speaking to media and appearing on television to discuss his defection and his life as a North Korean envoy. ?When Kim Jong-un first came to power, I was hopeful that he would make reasonable and rational decisions to save North Korea from poverty, but I soon fell into despair watching him purging officials for no proper reasons,? Thae said during his first news conference with foreign media on Wednesday.?Low-level dissent or criticism of the regime, until recently unthinkable, is becoming more frequent,? said Thae, who spoke in fluent, British-accented English. ?We have to spray gasoline on North Korea, and let the North Korean people set fire to it.? Thae, 54, has said publicly that dissatisfaction with Kim prompted him to flee his post. Two university-age sons and his wife defected with him.North and South Korea are technically still at war as their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The north, which is subject to UN sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes, regularly threatens to destroy the south and its main ally, the US. Thae is the most senior official to have fled North Korea and entered public life in the south since the 1997 defection of Hwang Jang-yop, the brains behind the North?s governing ideology, Juche, which combines Marxism and extreme nationalism. The modern North Korean system had ?nothing to do with true communism?, Thae said, adding that the elite had watched with unease as countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and the former Soviet Union embraced economic and social reforms. Thae has said more North Korean diplomats are waiting in Europe to defect to South Korea. North Korea still outwardly professes to maintain a Soviet-style command economy, but for years a thriving network of informal markets and person-to-person trading has become the main source of food and money for ordinary people. Fully embracing these reforms would end Kim Jong-un?s rule, Thae said. Asked if Kim?s brother, Kim Jong-chol, could run the country, Thae was sceptical. ?Kim Jong-chol has no interest in politics. He is only interested in music,? Thae said. ?He?s only interested in Eric Clapton. If he was a normal man, I?m sure he?d be a very good professional guitarist.?', 'While government is pushing for digital payments through mobile phones, chipset maker Qualcomm said that wallets and mobile banking applications in India are not using hardware level security which can make online transactions more secure. \"You will be surprised because most of the banking or wallet apps around the world don\\'t use hardware security. They actually run completely in Android mode and users password can be stolen. Users use fingerprint which might be captured ... in India that is the case for most of all digital wallets and mobile banking apps,\" Qualcomm Senior Director Product Management Sy Choudhury told reporters here. He said that even most famous digital payment application in India is not using hardware level security. \"Reason we are saying that none of them is using it because we work with OEMs (original equipment makers),\" Choudhury said. As per market research firm Strategy Analytics, Qualcomm leads mobile chipset market globally with 37 per cent share. \"Everyone is getting connected, everyone is getting authenticated by device. How do you know that your device is getting ready for demonetisation? When you download a mobile banking app you dont know if it is using hardware security or not,\" Choudhury said. He said that Qualcomm is now approaching digital payments companies for using secure environment for processing payments on mobile phone. \"We are providing secure execution environment in the chipsets. This layer separates transactions on mobile phone from operating system. This checks any malware from effecting transactions,\" Choudhury said. He said that Qualcomm is also coming up with new feature in its mobile chipsets from 2017 that verify user with payment gateway using unique features like device id, phone manufacturer signature, Android version in the phone, root kit of operating system, location and time, which will be nearly impossible to duplicate. \"Device attestation feature will start shipping in 2017.

The number, however, is drastically lower than Ramdevs earlier claim of three lakh participants in the event. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani received certificate of the record from the Guinness Book officials at Gandhinagar in the afternoon. The previous record was set in Delhi on June 21, 2015, when 35,985 people performed yoga at Rajpath with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As per the government release here, 54,522 people took part in the Yoga Day event at GMDC ground today, beating the earlier record by a margin of over 18,000. Besides, 22 other records, such as the maximum number of Surya Namaskars by one person, were also set during todays event and certified by the Guinness Book officials. Ramdev had claimed earlier in the morning that around three lakh people did yoga with him. \"Today is the most important day for me, as more than three lakh people performed yoga at one place to set a new world record. We have broken the previous world record, which was set in the presence of our PM, by a huge margin,\" Ramdev had told reporters after the event. BJP president Amit Shah, Chief Minister Rupani, Deputy CM Nitin Patel, former Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, several political leaders besides IAS, IPS officers and the high court judges took part in the event.

Leaders of various faiths were specially invited to the event, organised jointly by the BJP government in the state and Ramdevs Patanjali Yogpeeth. While giving instructions to participants during the event, Ramdev invited Shah and Rupani to join him on the dais and follow him in striking yogic postures.

The PLA Daily?s report suggested the gear was moved after the face-off began.The reports did not say whether China moved the equipment to support military drills held in Tibet, including in the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river, close to the border of India?s northeastern states, or for other reasons.Sources in the security establishment in New Delhi said there was ?no unusual military movement? in China during the past two months. The sources also said China had been conducting military exercises in the Tibet region since 2009. Ni Lexiong, a Shanghai-based military commentator, suggested to SCMP the movement of military equipment was most likely related to the standoff and could have been designed to bring India to the negotiating table.?Diplomatic talks must be backed by military preparation,? he said.Wang Dehua, from the South Asia Studies Centre at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, said the scale of the troop and equipment movement showed how much easier it is for China to defend its western borders.?Military operations are all about logistics,? he told SCMP. ?Now there is much better logistics support to the Tibet region.?Beijing has accused New Delhi of ?illegal trespass? in Donglang sector and said the withdrawal of Indian troops is a must for resolving the face-off and opening talks.Donglang is under the control of Beijing but the area at the strategic tri-junction of India, Bhutan and China is claimed by Thimphu.India has said the road being built by the Chinese troops has serious security implications and will alter the status quo in the region.Earlier this week, state-run CCTV beamed footage of PLA troops from a mountain brigade engaged in a military exercise with live ammunition in the Tibet region.

Construction of the lines is expected to start soon. The DMRC has already used up all the primary colours ? red, blue and yellow ? and secondary colours, which result from the mixing of the primary colours. Besides, Delhi metro also uses some of the tertiary colours, a mixture of the primary and secondary colours.DMRC has so far used red, yellow, blue, green, violet, pink, magenta, grey and orange.Some of the colours which the DMRC could use include rose, vermillion, azure and even black, though it is considered inauspicious by many in India.Officials said primary colours were used for phase I lines, secondary colours for phase II lines and for phase III (new lines), tertiary colours are chosen. DMRC has issued tenders for the topographical survey of the six lines after they approved by the Delhi government.Officials said construction of the new lines is likely to start by August though DMRC is awaiting approval of the central government.The lines under phase IV, in addition to the 140 kilometres added in phase III, are expected to free up traffic bottlenecks in congested central and southern parts of the city and help passengers from outer Delhi.The phase III of metro expansion is likely to be completed by mid-2017, officials added.', \"Priyanka Chopra has a superpower, the power to win over the world in outfits unimaginably chic.

When that attempt failed, an immigration judge then ordered his deportation from the US, thus making him ineligible to ever become a naturalised citizen.A resident of Houston, Singh, instead of leaving the country, changed his name, date of birth, the manner in which he entered the US and his familial history so that he could obtain lawful immigration status, and later naturalisation, based on a marriage to a US citizen.In the process of obtaining the citizenship, he denied ever being ordered deported, seeking asylum or using a different identity. ?In addition, Singh sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2013. In it, he complained about the anxiety and frustration he experienced in having to wait for an extended period at the airport every time he returned from an international trip due to discrepancies in his biometric information. He requested DHS clear these discrepancies,? the Justice Department said.After obtaining the citizenship, a fingerprint comparison established the man previously ordered deported from the US (Balbir Singh) and the man who later became a naturalised citizen (Ranjit Singh) were one and the same.Accepting the plea, US district judge Ewing Werlein set sentencing for October 13.', 'At least 200 girls were rushed to a hospital from their school on Saturday morning in?Delhi?s Tughlakabad after a gas leak from a nearby container depot left some of them unconscious and others with nausea and irritation in eyes.

Officials from Delhi Police and the National Disaster Response Force were attempting to identify the chemical and how it leaked.It was unclear if the truck was inside the container depot or the driver had begun to drive away with the leak, said a fire official.Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal also visited the hospitals where the children were being treated.', 'A female engineer at Tesla who accused the car manufacturer of ignoring her complaints of sexual harassment and paying her less than her male counterparts has been fired in what her lawyer alleges was an act of retaliation.AJ Vandermeyden, who went public with her discrimination lawsuit against Elon Musk?s car company in an interview with the Guardian in February, was dismissed from the company this week.Vandermeyden had claimed she was taunted and catcalled by male employees and that Tesla failed to address her complaints about the harassment, unequal pay and discrimination. ?It?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to have,? she said at the time.In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired Vandermeyden, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee?s allegations with the help of a ?a neutral, third-party expert? and concluded her complaints were unmerited.?Despite repeatedly receiving special treatment at the expense of others, Ms Vandermeyden nonetheless chose to pursue a miscarriage of justice by suing Tesla and falsely attacking our company in the press,? a Tesla spokesperson said. ?After we carefully considered the facts on multiple occasions and were absolutely convinced that Ms Vandermeyden?s claims were illegitimate, we had no choice but to end her employment at Tesla.??This was absolutely shocking for AJ. She is devastated,? Therese Lawless, Vandermeyden?s attorney, said by phone. ?She brought the lawsuit in an attempt to make the workplace at Tesla more equitable and fair and to have Tesla comply with the law.?Asked about Tesla?s justification for the firing, Lawless said: ?They?ve just proven our case. It?s clear retaliation.? She added: ?Somebody is trying to instill in employees that when they speak out about matters they are legally allowed to speak out about, they too will be fired.? Vandermeyden?s firing is likely to reignite debate over employment standards in Silicon Valley, where startups and major tech corporations are grappling with complaints of systemic wage disparities, gender discrimination and sexual misconduct.An account of alleged sexism at Uber went viral earlier this year, fueling debate about harassment in the industry, while a recent federal lawsuit against Google has placed a spotlight on concerns about tech firms underpaying women.  Lawless, who represented the former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao in her high-profile discrimination lawsuit, against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, said she intended to file a formal retaliation complaint on behalf of Vandermeyden. ?It is illegal in the state of California for an employer to retaliate against an employee who asserts her rights, including her rights to receive equal pay as her male colleagues.?Vandermeyden, who started working at Tesla in 2013, claims in her lawsuit that she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly took over as a manufacturing engineer in the general assembly department.Her complaint further alleged that she raised issues about flaws in the quality testing of cars that her supervisors and male engineers had missed. Although she came up with a solution, men were granted positions over her, she alleged. The complaint said that she and other female engineers were denied promotions despite the fact that they were ?equally or more qualified? than the men.Vandermeyden also alleged that she experienced ?unwelcome and pervasive harassment by men on the factory floor including but not limited to inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls?.Further, the lawsuit accused Tesla of retaliating against her for speaking up. Management allegedly told her that in order to advance her position, she would need to achieve a performance standard in the factory that was not expected of male engineers and was unattainable. Although she had positive performance evaluations, she felt she had to transfer out of general assembly to the purchasing department, according to the lawsuit, which also said that Tesla retaliated against her for being a ?whistleblower?. Tesla has continued to strongly reject Vandermeyden?s claims. A spokesperson said the company had ?conducted a thorough internal investigation? and ?extensively re-reviewed all the facts?, repeatedly concluding that her allegations were false. Tesla added that Vandermeyden had been granted numerous positions ?over other more qualified candidates? and was ?given special treatment and opportunities for advancement that were unwarranted based on her qualifications?.?The termination was based on Ms Vandermeyden behaving in what the evidence indicates is a fundamentally false and misleading manner, not as a result of retaliation for the lawsuit,? the spokesperson added. ?It is impossible to trust anyone after they have behaved in such a manner and therefore continued employment is also impossible.?The Vandermeyden case is one of several labor issues that have dogged Tesla, which is facing growing scrutiny over its practices in California. Earlier this month, the Guardian published an investigation into working conditions at Tesla?s ?factory of the future? in Fremont, California, where several factory workers complained about their treatment at the plant.Incident reports revealed that ambulances have been called more than 100 times since 2014 for workers experiencing fainting spells, seizures, dizziness, abnormal breathing and chest pains. A recent report from a worker safety organization found that Tesla workers were injured at a rate 31% higher than the industry average in 2015.The company has said it has significantly improved safety standards in recent months at the factory, and Musk told the Guardian he cared deeply about the health and wellbeing of his employees. Vandermeyden, in her interview with the Guardian in February, emphasized that she believed Tesla was a ?revolutionary and innovative company? and said she took out a hefty loan to buy the cheapest version of the Model S car.?Until somebody stands up, nothing is going to change,? she added. ?I?m an advocate of Tesla. I really do believe they are doing great things. That said, I can?t turn a blind eye if there?s something fundamentally wrong going on.?At the time, Vandermeyden said she was hopeful her lawsuit and public comments would not end her career at the company. But she expressed some concern that her decision to speak out could result in retaliation. ?Half the time when I walk into work,? she said, ?I wonder if my badge is going to work.?Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com', 'Mumbai, Jun 6 (PTI) Jet Airways domestic pilots body NAG will convene a meeting tomorrow to chart out an \"action plan\" following the questioning of some of its members by the Delhi Police over alleged posting of obscene messages on a WhatsApp group.

Of the 8,591 highway liquor shops affected by the Supreme Court order, 2,000 are yet to be relocated while 3,000 shop owners have surrendered their liquor licences, said UP Excise Minister Jai Pratap Singh. \"We have incurred a loss of about Rs 5,000 crore in 2016-17 fiscal ending March 31. Out of the target of realising Rs 19,000 crore, the excise department could generate Rs 14,000 crore following the apex court order order,\" the minister told PTI. The Supreme Court had last year ordered a ban on all liquor shops along national as well as state highways across the country and prohibited all signages indicating presence of liquor vends. The Supreme Court again on March 31 reiterated its December 15, 2016 order to shut down, by April 1, establishments selling and serving liquor within 500 metres of national and state highways, but relaxed the distance to 220 m for cities, towns and municipal areas with a population of 20,000 or less. According to latest data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), accidents due to drunk driving have the highest fatality rate among all accidents. NCRB data showed that some 42 per cent of drunk driving victims ended up dead in 2015 ? this was a far higher rate than that of accidents caused by over speeding and reckless driving. Highlighting his departments initiatives for going cashless, Singh said, \"We are introducing a cashless system in liquor shops and asking them to install point-of-sale (POS) machines. Though it will difficult in rural areas, we are asking shops to switch over to cashless payments.\" On media reports suggesting that the cashless system is being introduced to deter teenagers from purchasing liquor, the minister said there is already a law which does not allow sale of liquor to minors. About sale of liquor near religious places and schools, he said, \"An SC order in 2008 says no to liquor vending with a radius of 75 metre of a school or religious place. But, with increase in population density, the number of schools and hospitals have increased leading to conflicts.\" \"We have decided that no liquor shop will be relocated within 500 metre of religious places or hospitals. In case of objection, even residential colonies will come under the ambit. At the moment it is not in a very formal shape. But we are working on it,\" the minister said. About excise revenue expectations for 2017-18, the minister said his department has fixed a target of Rs 20,000 crore. The minister said that Yogi Adityanath government will introduce its new excise policy from April 2018 and the government plans to break the syndicate system in liquor trade. \"We are working on the new excise policy before finalising it,\" he said. The new excise policy may introduce a system of bar code on each bottle in a bid to check black marketing and pilferage in liquor sale, mostly in country-made alcohol products. ', 'Donald Trump has forced out Reince Priebus as the White House chief of staff and replaced him with the homeland security secretary, Gen John Kelly.Trump tweeted: ?I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House chief of staff. He is a great American ? and a great leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my administration.?The departure of Priebus came as little surprise after he was the subject of a furious, foul-mouthed attack by new communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who claimed he would be asked to quit imminently. Priebus told the Wall Street Journal in a text message that he resigned privately on Thursday.Trump ? who in six months has now lost a chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, national security adviser, communications director and press secretary ? added on Twitter: ?I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him!?According to a pooled report, Trump sent the tweets shortly after Air Force One landed back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, following a trip to Long Island, New York. Priebus and Scaramucci were also on the flight.In a statement, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said: ?General John Kelly is one of the true stars of the administration. He has helped seal the border and reduced illegal immigration by 70%. He is respected by everyone, especially the people at the Department of Homeland Security.?The entire administration loves him and no one is comparable. He will begin on Monday morning and a cabinet meeting will follow his swearing in Monday morning.?She added: ?The president thanks Reince Priebus for his service. They accomplished a lot together. He was loyal in his dedication to the president. The president thanks him and his family for his great service to the country, and he will always be a member of the Trump team.?Sanders then spoke to reporters outside her office. Asked if the decision was Priebus?s or Trump?s, she replied: ?We all serve at the pleasure of the president. The conversations about this started with the president and Reince about two weeks ago, in terms of timing.?She denied that the change had anything do with Scaramucci, and said Trump and Kelly had been ?talking about it for a while?.On Friday, Priebus said in a statement: ?It has been one of the greatest honours of my life to serve this president and our country. I want to thank the president for giving me this very special opportunity. I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the president?s agenda and policies. I can?t think of a better person than John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him God?s blessings and great success.?In an interview with CNN just two hours after his departure was announced, Priebus paid homage to Trump. ?I am going to honor the president every day,? he said, adding: ?I?m always going to be a Trump fan. I?m on Team Trump.? He refused to respond to Scaramucci?s comments, saying: ?I?m not going to get into the mud.?While Priebus insisted he had resigned, there were strong hints that there was more under the surface. He said on CNN that the president had wanted to ?hit the reset button? and ?intuitively determined that it was time to do something differently?.On Friday, House speaker Paul Ryan, a close Priebus ally who has had a tense relationship with Trump, said: ?Reince Priebus has left it all out on the field, for our party and our country. Here is a guy from Kenosha, Wisconsin, who revitalized the Republican national committee and became White House chief of staff. He has served the president and the American people capably and passionately. He has achieved so much, and he has done it all with class. I could not be more proud to call Reince a dear friend.?He added: ?I congratulate Secretary Kelly on his appointment, and look forward to working with him to advance our agenda.?Priebus was one of the least powerful chiefs of staff in recent history, and his future had long been a matter of speculation. In a highly unorthodox move, Trump decided that Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon would serve as ?equal partners? in implementing his agenda.The gossip intensified rapidly a week ago, when Scaramucci was appointed as communications director despite Priebus?s objections. The former Wall Street banker claimed they were ?like brothers? but tensions soon flared.Scaramucci clearly suspected Priebus of leaking information to the media. This led him to call the New Yorker and give an interview in which he described Priebus as ?a fucking paranoid schizophrenic? who would soon be asked to resign.On Tuesday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that no staff shakeup was in the cards. But according to media reports, he privately floated potential replacements including Kelly, deputy national security adviser Dina Powell, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and former campaign adviser David Urban.In an interview earlier this week, Michael Steele, predecessor of Priebus as chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), said: ?It?s very clear the president has very little confidence in him. Reince?s head is on the block, as was Sean Spicer?s. Sean just got up and removed himself before the axe came down.?Priebus is the latest casualty in Trump?s West Wing. Others include national security adviser Michael Flynn, former deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, press secretary Sean Spicer and press aide Michael Short.Priebus went out of his way to appease Trump?s insurgent candidacy during the 2016 election campaign. After Trump?s victory in the Indiana primary and Ted Cruz?s decision to drop out, Priebus declared Trump the presumptive nominee, though Ohio governor John Kasich was still in the race, and then used the full muscle of the RNC to quash efforts to deny Trump the Republican nomination at the party convention in Cleveland.He also went in person to Trump Tower in 2015 for Trump to sign a loyalty oath to the Republican party, a deeply unusual step for an RNC chair to court such a recalcitrant candidate.Kelly, meanwhile, has been arguably Trump?s favourite cabinet secretary and is leading efforts to build a wall on the Mexican border. Kelly ran the US southern command, which includes the military prison at GuantÃ¡namo Bay. In 2010, his son, Lt Robert Michael Kelly, was killed after stepping on a landmine in Afghanistan.In a Memorial Day speech at Arlington national cemetery earlier this year, Trump said: ?I especially want to extend our gratitude to Secretary John Kelly for joining us today. Incredible man. I always like to call him General. He understands more than most ever could or ever will the wounds and burdens of war.?Kelly said in a statement he was honoured to be asked to serve as chief of staff, adding praise for the staff of the homeland security department: ?When I left the Marines, I never thought I would find as committed, as professional, as patriotic a group of individuals. I was wrong. You accomplish great things every day defending our nation and I know your exceptional work will continue.?Kelly?s appointment leaves a gap at the Department of Homeland Security. Claire McCaskill, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee, said: ?General Kelly has a long history of service to our country and I had a good working relationship with him as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. With the threats facing this nation, I urge the president to nominate a qualified secretary to replace General Kelly as quickly as possible.?In a week of exceptional turmoil, Trump has also turned his ire on Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, accusing him of weakness for recusing himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign?s alleged collusion with Russia.', 'The state government announced a Rs10-lakh ex-gratia payment for the kin of two pilgrims from Dahanu who died in the terror attack in Anantnag on Monday.

', 'Nisheeth Jha, the husband of Assamese actor Bidisha Bezbaruah who allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself from a ceiling fan, was on Thursday sent to 14 days in judicial custody. Before a magistrate remanded him in judicial custody, Jha admitted to his interrogators that there was another woman in his life, police said.During a day-long police remand, Jha confessed that this strained his relations with Bidisha. ?We are searching call details, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter accounts of Jha to ascertain the reasons behind the victim?s extreme step,? a senior police officer said.Jha was arrested on Tuesday night on charges of abetment to suicide after Bidisha?s father, Aswini Kumar Bezbaruah, accused him of having an extra-marital affair. Bidisha?s body was found hanging on Monday evening in a flat at Sushant Apartments in Sector 43 of Gurugram. Police said Jha was out of Gurugram when she killed herself. The couple earlier had an argument over Jha?s relationship with the other woman.According to Assistant Commissioner of Police Harinder Singh, Bidisha had moved into the rented flat at Sushant Apartments on Sunday.Her body was discovered by a property dealer who along with some neighbours broke into her flat after Jha contacted him saying she was not responding to his phone calls, police said. No suicide note was found at the site.Bidisha had moved to Gurugram last week with Jha and joined an Udyog Vihar-based public relations agency here. Jha hails from Vadodara in Gujarat and works in a private company.The couple got married on April 28 last year.  Police said Bidisha had made an appearance in recently-released Bollywood movie Jagga Jasoos in a dance sequence. She was well known in the Assamese TV industry where she acted in a number of serials and was also a playback singer.', 'The National Zoological Park in New Delhi is exploring options to launch an animal adoption scheme for its inmates. The suggestion had come from the Union environment and forest minister, Harsh Vardhan, a few weeks ago. Several zoos across India have already launched the scheme where a citizen or a corporate firm can adopt an animal.?We are exploring various options to start an animal adoption scheme at the Delhi Zoo. We would launch the scheme once we finalise the modalities,? Renu Singh, director of the National Zoological Park told HT.It is a scheme where a citizen can choose an animal and ?adopt? it after paying a sum fixed by the zoo authorities. The money is usually spent by the zoo to buy food, medicines and to meet other expenses of the animal. In return, the person?s name is displayed on the cage, gets an adoption certificate and free entry to the zoo for a year, among other facilities. Also, the adopter can celebrate birthdays of the animals in the zoo and in some cases he also gets exemption from Income-Tax under section 80 (G) of the Income-Tax Act. Although the scheme is for all animals in the zoo, sources said that usually the scheme is for large animals like tigers, lions and elephants, which require maximum expenditure. In Kolkata, one has to shell out ?2 lakh to adopt a tiger for a year. Birds cost the minimum. ?But there is a difference between the Delhi zoo and other zoos in the country. While the Delhi Zoo is the only zoo in the country which is directly run by the Union ministry, others are managed by the respective state governments. Most of the other zoos which have launched adoption schemes are registered societies and can accept money in the adoption scheme. We can?t,? said Singh.Zoo authorities are now studying the adoption schemes launched by various Indian and foreign zoos to find a way in which it could launch a scheme.?It won?t be like other zoos as we can?t accept money directly. For that we have to register the zoo as a society which would be a long and cumbersome process. So we are planning it differently and that is why we are exploring options,? she added. Several zoos in India such as the Lucknow Zoo, Patna Zoo, Alipore Zoo in Kolkata, Mysore Zoo and Nandankanan in Odisha have already launched such initiatives. ?Even though the contribution we receive is just a token amount of what we spend against each animal, the main objective is the bond that citizens develop with the animals and the people?s participation,? said a senior official of the Alipore Zoo in Kolkata. The Delhi Zoo is also in the process to start celebrating a birthday bash for its inmates. The first birthday party of a white Tiger named Vijay would be celebrated on July 21.', 'AAP found ammunition to gun for the BJP on Monday after it emerged that the saffron party\\'s Inderpuri candidate for this month\\'s municipal polls, who was touted as a slum dweller and the face of the city\\'s urban poor, happens to be a millionaire. Meet Sunita Kaushik, who was handpicked by the party\\'s city chief Manoj Tiwari. The BJP went on the defensive after she told the state election commission in an affidavit that she has assets worth Rs 1.35 crore, including three residential houses in west Delhi. However, Kaushik is not an income-tax payer. Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Dilip Pandey termed the BJP\\'s support for the slum dwellers and residents of unauthorised colonies in Delhi \"hypocrisy\" and \"fake\". By portraying a millionaire candidate as a slum dweller, the BJP has hurt the sentiments of the poor,\" he said. \"It is an insult to lakhs of people living in Delhi\\'s slums and unauthorised colonies in a pitiable condition.\" KAUSHIK\\'S PLUNGE INTO DELHI POLITICSKaushik\\'s plunge into Delhi politics was no less than a scene out of a Bollywood movie. Tiwari, who was on a visit to the Inderpuri slums this New Year\\'s Eve, met the woman who came to the BJP president alleging that \"politicians never listened to the problems of the poor\". straight talk, Tiwari assured her of a \"solution\" and it surprised many when he declared Kaushik as the BJP\\'s candidate from the local municipal ward. It was Tiwari\\'s first visit to Delhi\\'s slums after taking charge of Delhi BJP last year. He had spent the night of December 31, 2016 with the residents of Todapur slums where he also met Sunita Kaushik. \"During the BJP president\\'s visit, she had said that politicians don\\'t listen to the poor. To this, she was promised a solution. Today she is a BJP candidate,\" the party\\'s city unit had said in a statement after announcing her candidature. A senior leader said the BJP had also ensured her ticketkeeping in view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s vision to strengthen the weaker sections. \"My visits were a reality check on the condition of slums and unauthorised colonies under the AAP government. I was pained to hear that politicians do not listen to the poor,\" Tiwari said about the interaction at the shanties. PROPERTIES OF SUNITA KAUSHIKKaushik is a millionaire with two houses and jewellery worthÂ\\xa0 Rs 97 lakh. She disclosed that she owns two residential properties measuring 720 square feet and 553 square feet at Dasghara in Inderpuri whose market price is pegged at Rs 50 lakh and Rs 32 lakh, respectively. Her husband, Shashi Bhushan, also owns a house worth Rs 10 lakh. The couple possesses jewellery worth Rs 7 lakh. Kaushik\\'s share in it is valued at Rs 6 lakh. The affidavit also disclosed that she has Rs 50,000 in cash while her husband carries Rs 85,000. However, she only has Rs 1,000 in her bank account, a little more than her spouse\\'s Rs 576. BJP leaders refused to comment on the assets declared by its candidate but said its pick was aimed at supporting the less-privileged. \"While no other party has ever stood with the slum dwellers, the BJP is the only party to have chosen its candidate from the weaker sections. It has been done with a strong intent to strengthen the poor,\" said a party leader.Also Read:Ahead of MCD Polls, AAP slapped with another grievance by RWAs', \"The Supreme Court has sought the Centre and the RBI's response on why they did not give a window to citizens to deposit demonetised currency after December 31.

When I started in the industry, people had helped me; so why not extend that favour to others.I know how it feels  when people call you an outsider. It?s disturbing,? says Richa, who has been part of the industry for nine years now with films such as Gangs of Wasseypur (2012), Masaan (2015)  and Sarbjit (2016) to her credit. Richa has also turned producer of regional films recently.The 30-year-old actor says it is unfair to give an actor the tag of an outsider. ? This stance is a cause of worry. With this,  you are basically  telling people, who are not born in the film fraternity, that  they  don?t have a chance. That?s not a good thing for the industry because then the talented ones will not come forward. If you give a chance to people, talent  will come from  all parts of India . But, if only one kind of idea is perpetuated, it kills diversity,? she says.Talking about being part of content driven cinema in Bollywood, Richa, who made her debut with Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye (2008), says she always wanted to be part of memorable films. ?When I did Oye Lucky, I had just finished my education and didn?t have the guidance and the maturity to decide what kind of genre I should do. In fact, after that, for two years, I did TV commercials and not films. Then Gangs of  Wasseypur happened and I have been lucky to do  good roles. I guess it?s a two-way thing, I get good roles and I do them well. I always wanted to be in films that would be memorable.

Though Mukherjee would exit Rashtrapati Bhavan, his contributions as president would be remembered for a long time to come.Pranab Mukherjee did not just confine himself to being a copy president. He took several initiatives in several spheres of life which would go a long way to inspire several generations to come.1. DEMOCRATISATION OF PRESIDENCYThe Rashtrapati Bhavan, on the first anniversary of Pranab Mukherjee's term, made a number of announcements in a bid to democratise the institution of presidency. It did away with the honorific 'His Excellency' used to address the president. Governors of states were also encouraged to follow the practice.The protocol and security restrictions on guests invited to Rashtrapati Bhavan were relaxed to the maximum extent possible.Pranab Mukherjee's predecessors would take part in several activities in different parts of the capital. But these would inconvenience the common man. To avoid this, a decision was taken to have as many functions as possible within the Rashtrapati Bhavan itself in order to avoid disruption of traffic and any inconvenience to public.2. ORDINANCES AND MERCY PETITIONSPranab Mukherjee promulgated or re-promulgated 26 ordinances during his tenure. In the fifth year, he promulgated five ordinances.In the same period, he commuted four mercy petitions and rejected 30, second only to R Venkatraman, who rejected 45 mercy pleas.KR Narayanan and his successor Abdul Kalam came to be known for sitting on mercy petitions. Narayanan, in fact, did not act upon a single mercy petition sent to him. Kalam cleared two petitions during his tenure, commuting one and rejecting the other.On the other hand, President Pranab Mukherjee's immediate predecessor Pratibha Patil earned the reputation of being one of India's most lenient heads of state. She commuted saw 34 pleas and rejected five.3. TEACHER PRANAB MUKHERJEEPresident Pranab Mukherjee also created a record of sorts by becoming the first head of state to teach school children. During the last two years of his presidency, he did what he used to do over 50 years ago - teach. He held classes at a school within the premises of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Mukherjee, a Master's degree holder in history, political science and law, taught about 80 students of classes 11 and 12 at the Rajendra Prasad Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in the President's Estate. He imparted lesson to students on the history of Indian politics. He also spoke about the rising menace of terrorism in the country and outside.4. RASHTRAPATI BHAVAN ON TWITTERThe Rashtrapati Bhavan's Twitter account was launched on July 1, 2014 to connect directly with the public and disseminate information on the President's activities. The account gained about 102,000 followers in 20 days. As President Pranab Mukherjee demits office, Rashtrapati Bhavan has 3,297,391 followers on Twitter.5. MUSEUMA new museum in a heritage building - the Carriage Halls and the Stables - earlier used for horses and to house buggies, has been converted into a state-of-the-art museum. It highlights landmark events starting from Delhi Durbar of 1911 to the oath taking by first President Rajendra Prasad. The museum also displays a part of the collection of arms, some furniture fashioned by Lutyens, activities of the President's Body Guard and a rich collection of gifts offered to the President by Indian and foreign dignitaries. Another 10,000 square meter museum has been developed underground to portray the history of Rashtrapati Bhavan in a high-tech story-telling format. This is the 'speaking museum' where the Rashtrapati Bhavan narrates its story. The exhibits are supported by modern conservation laboratory, resource centre for visitors' activities and a cyber-library with information bank.6. SMARTGRAM INITIATIVEPresident Pranab Mukherjee launched 'Smartgram' initiative on July 2, 2016 with an aim to develop villages into Humane, Happy and Hi-Tech townships.

This proposal was unanimously passed by BMC house, but ex-mayor didn\\'t make any law.

There are certain issues over this in the acquisition wing,\" Defence sources told MAIL TODAY.The progress of the deal may come up for discussion during the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow planned early next month.However, senior ministry officials said Make in India comes at a heavy cost as investments have to be made to create a new facility and manpower has to be trained along with acquisition of land for the new set up.The government had selected HAL as a partner but later on it also thought of including a private sector partner for the joint venture company to promote private participation in defence but this is going to add further cost to the programme, the sources said.H.A.L YET TO TAKE FINAL CALLThe decision on selecting the private sector partner has to be taken by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and the company is yet to take a final call on the issue.The deal is also getting affected by the issue over the weight of the choppers, as it is believed that the ones built in Russia weigh more than what was specified in the tender requirements by the force.\"The issue has been raised with the Russians and it is expected that some solutions would be found for reducing the weight soon,\" a source said.Sources said there seemed to be a minor issue over the interpretation of the clauses on the transfer of technology for the Kamov choppers as during one of the meetings, the Russians proposed to supply the 140 choppers to built in India as complete knocked-down and semi-knocked down kits -which would mean that the choppers would only be assembled and not built in India.TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY\"We are very clear that we want transfer of technology for these choppers so that they can be built in future by our firms on their own in the future,\" a defence official said.Price has been a critical issue in defence deals involving Russia as several deals such as the under-development Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft and Multirole Transport Aircraft projects have been stuck because of the sudden and exorbitant cost hikes by Moscow.The biggest example of India suffering due to price hike was the INS Vikramaditya aircraft carrier project, which was to cost $900 million (over Rs 5,000 crore)at the time of signing in 2004, but was delivered in 2014 after an additional cost of $1.2 billion (over Rs 7,000 crore) in 2014.ALSO READ | Indian Army may acquire 39 American Apache choppers to enhance fire power at Pakistan, China borders', \"Breaking fashion stereotypes and debunking myths about the 'perfect' body have always been unique to the Lakme Fashion Week (LFW).

Smartphones can now help you finish your math homework by giving step-by-step solutions to hard-to-crack algebra equations, thanks to a new artificial intelligence (AI) app developed by engineers including one of Indian origin. The app, created by US-based start up Socratic, allows students to learn how to answer a question just by snapping a photo of it. \"Again and again, we hear that students struggle with math. Every student takes math, often for multiple years, and it can be hard to get help from parents and friends,\" said Shreyans Bhansali, Head of Engineering at Socratic. \"We wanted to create an experience that walks students through their problems, and teaches the concepts behind the problem,\" Bhansali said. The app reads math questions - even handwritten ones - and gives students step-by-step solutions and explanations that teach them the underlying concepts and help answer all types of math problems. To build the app, the team looked through countless math questions asked by students and categorised them by the steps required to solve them. Then, they wrote high quality Explainers to teach these concepts and tested them with hundreds of high school students. In parallel, the engineering team built algorithms that allow a computer to solve math problems step-by-step. They incorporated data collected from students so that steps closely match those a great teacher or tutor would provide to a student.

In her recent interview with YouTuber Hanee Chavan, Sunny opens up on her childhood, first kiss and first heartbreak.ALSO SEE: Sunny Leone\\'s bathtub pictures with Daniel Weber are too hot to handleSunny revealed that her first heartbreak happened when her family moved from Michigan to California, and she had to leave behind her high school boyfriend, who used to write her sweet love letters. It was a fairytale romance - they even kissed for the first time after watching Romeo and Juliet! And while she was smitten, her parents hated him. It is no surprise, because she went on to reveal that her father actually caught them making out.Sunny elaborates, \"I was at school, and I lied that I had to do after-school stuff. I was at one end of the hallyway, sitting on his lap and we were making out, and I hear my dad walking down the hallway.

Researchers hope that this new instrument will help empower and rehabilitate patients with motor disabilities such as those from stroke, spinal cord injury or amputation.?The Encephalophone is a musical instrument that you control with your thoughts,? explained first author Thomas Deuel from the University of Washington. ?I am a musician and neurologist, and I?ve seen many patients with motor impairment, who can no longer play an instrument or sing,? said Deuel. ?I thought it would be great to use a brain-computer instrument to enable patients to play music again without requiring movement.?Deuel originally developed the Encephalophone (patent pending) in his own independent laboratory, in collaboration with Felix Darvas, a physicist at the University of Washington.  The Encephalophone can be controlled via two independent types of brain signals: either those associated with the visual cortex (ie closing one?s eyes), or those associated with thinking about movementThe Encephalophone is based on brain-computer interfaces using an old method, called electroencephalography, which measures electrical signals in the brain. Scientists first began converting these signals into sounds in the 1930s and, later, into music in the 1960s. But these methods were still difficult to control and were not easily accessible to non-specialist users.Follow @htlifeandstyle for more. ', 'He could not serve the nation and its people while alive. But in death, 22-year-old ITBP recruit Roshan Kumar became the saviour for half a dozen families. Days after he received news of his first posting with the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the Uttarakhand native died in a road accident last week in Delhi\\'s Dwarka area where he was visiting relatives. But six of his vital organs became life-savers for as many transplant patients at hospitals in the Capital. India has a huge gap in demand and supply of organs. Experts say many people are unwilling to donate relatives\\' organs due to religious beliefs, because they don\\'t understand how it works, or because it is too difficult to do so due to red tape. Roshan belonged to an army background, and was brought up by an uncle. \"When he was just one year old, his parents died. I looked after him. From his very childhood and schooldays he wanted to become a soldier and serve the country. For this, he worked very hard. His dream was about to become reality. Now Roshan is not at the border to protect the country. But I am proud to say that he served the nation by saving six lives,\" Roshan\\'s uncle told Mail Today, requesting anonymity. According to government data, about 2 lakh people are waitlisted for kidneys and 30,000 for livers. Legal donations meet about 3 to 5 per cent of the demand. ROSHAN WAS HIT BY A SPEEDING BIKEIn desperation, some patients on the waiting list seek the services of middlemen to procure organs for money illegally. Dr AK Rai, medical superintendent of Safdarjung Hospital, told Mail Today, \"Last week, late night we received a call from a Dwarka-based hospital that they were referring a severely injured accident patient to us. We activated our expert team as the patient had very little chance of survival. Even in the time of grief, family members of the deceased agreed to donate the organs of their young son to fulfil his only wish to serve the country.\" Roshan was on foot when he was hit by a speeding bike and fell, receiving serious brain injuries.Doctors retrieved the organs in quick time. \"After the patient was declared brain dead and the family agreed to donate his all organs, experts\\' team from NOTTO (National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organisation) and Safdarjung Hospital started the procedure of organ retrieval,\" said (Prof) Dr Anup Kumar, head of renal transplant department at Safdarjung. HE SERVED HIS NATION IN DEATH\"All potential organs such as eyes, heart, liver, kidneys and intestine were procured, which gave fresh lease of life to six patients. Two people got eyes and one patient at AIIMS received the heart. Two patients got kidneys, one got a liver and the intestines were sent to Medanta hospital.\" Roshan\\'s act is a message of brotherhood and harmony for the nation, say doctors. \"He is a gem,\" Dr Kumar said. \"One of his kidneys was transplanted to a Muslim patient at Safardjung Hospital who was on dialysis for two years and could not find any donor.\" Speaking to Mail Today, 47-year-old Parvez Alam who stays at Khanpur in south Delhi, said, \"I am blessed that I have received a kidney from a Hindu patient who was brain dead. Roshan proved Hindu-Muslim Bhai Bhai. I was searching for a kidney for the past two years, but the miracle happened when I was in the last stage of dialysis. May Roshan\\'s soul rest in peace.\" On Tuesday, Safdarjung Hospital felicitated Roshan\\'s family. \"If a person is dedicated to fulfil his dreams, he or she can do it even when not alive,\" said Dr Sangeeta Sehrawat, organ retrieval coordinator at the institute. \"One needs only determination and this was proved by this inspiring young defence personnel.\"', \"Morning walkers on the beach of temple town Puri were in for a shock on Monday when they discovered the body of a dead whale that had been swept ashore by the waves.The 30-feet-long carcass was seen lying on the beach near the Pantha Niwas. Locals suspect that the whale may have died after being hit by a vessel in deep sea. Later, forest officials reached the spot to recover the carcass. The carcass resulted in a foul smell that spread across the area and a crane was brought in to lift the dead whale away.This is the second such incident in less than two months on the Puri beach. Earlier in February, another such whale carcass was found at Puri's Balukhanda beach.Last year, in December another 42-foot-long whale carcass was recovered from the Baidhara Pentha beach in Puri.Scientists are worried about the trend given the sudden rise in the number of such mammals being killed. Forest department officials have sent the body for post-mortem to ascertain the exact reason for the deaths.(With inputs from Mohd Suffian)A 32-feet-long whale carcass found on Odisha's Puri beach near Panthanivas earlier today.

If any destructive storms damage the reef system, the insurer will pay out sums likely to be $25m to $70m in any given year.Any payouts will be used for restoration of the reef, for instance by building artificial structures that can increase the height of the reef in case of storm damage.Corals from the reef can be removed and rested for a period of weeks or months, to help them regrow, at which point they can be safely reattached to their native habitat to regenerate the growth of the reef system. The advantages of such restoration go far beyond the hotels that border the seafront. As well as providing a natural brake against destructive storms, coral reefs provide nurseries for fish when they are growing, and form a vital part of the marine ecosystem. Their health or decline is seen as one of the key indicators of the state of the natural environment globally.The CancÃºn scheme, which is to be run by Swiss Re and the Nature Conservancy, with backing from the Mexican government, is thought to be one of the first in the world to tie environmental benefits and the ?eco-system services? provided by natural environmental features to firm monetary costs and rewards. It could provide a model for similar projects in the future, linking the protection and preservation of the environment to payouts in case of disaster.Hotels and private companies are signing up to the scheme at present, and the plan is for a fund backed by the government that will cover the premiums. This is scheduled to be activated in September, with further contracts to be signed in November and December, and full coverage will then begin from next January.?Public-private partnerships are the key,? said Mark Tercek, chief executive of the Nature Conservancy, in an interview with the Guardian. He predicted that more governments would see the advantages of such an approach when the CancÃºn scheme begins formal operation.?I used to get very frustrated that not enough was happening [to protect the environment],? said Tercek. ?We have to push business leaders to go further, to stick their neck out to tackle issues beyond the short term.?Tercek said the CancÃºn scheme would provide an example for businesses, governments and insurance firms that would be ?very scalable around the world?.A future target for similar insurance products could be mangrove swamps, which also protect the shore against storm damage, and are equally under threat, with many destroyed to make way for housing development or farming, and others in peril from climate change.', \"Popular Bollywood celebrities like Abhishek Bachchan, Jacqueline Fernandez and Ritesh Deshmukh, among many others wished Priyanka Chopra on her 35th birthday on Tuesday.Priyanka -- an actor, singer and film producer -- won the Miss World 2000 pageant and has received numerous awards, including a National Film Award and five Filmfare Awards.

Things have to change.\"The Netherlands, which failed to qualify for the European Championship last year, looks likely to struggle to reach the World Cup in Russia.France stayed on top of the group with 13 points after beating Luxembourg 3-1 thanks to Olivier Giroud\\'s double and a penalty by Antoine Griezmann.Sweden is second with 10 points after thrashing Belarus 4-0. The Netherlands slid to fourth with seven points, behind Bulgaria with nine.RONALDO AT THE DOUBLERonaldo appears to have found his ideal partner up front for in Andre Silva.The 21-year-old striker scored Portugal\\'s opener in the 32nd before quickly getting Ronaldo on track.Ronaldo struck both goals from outside the area, first slashing home a left-footer off Silva\\'s pass, followed by a right-footed free kick from an angle to seal the win in Lisbon.\"We started off slowly, but the first goal gave our confidence a boost and the other goals came naturally,\" Ronaldo told Portuguese television.Portugal strengthened its hold on second place with 12 points, opening a gap over Hungary, which stayed with seven points in third.Switzerland earned a fifth win in as many matches after beating Latvia 1-0 to remain on top of the group with 15 points.Still stuck at the foot of the table, Andorra nevertheless savored the end to a losing streak that had lasted 58 competitive matches stretching over 11 years after drawing with Faroe Islands 0-0.LUKAKU RESCUES BELGIUMRomelu Lukaku saved Belgium\\'s place at the top of Group H, snatching a 1-1 draw in Brussels after being frustrated all night by an unyielding Greece defense.

In fact, it\\'s been on the verge of a catastrophic breakdown for quite some time now, with big-ticket companies looking to both hand over pink slips to incumbent employees as well as hire less talent. Nearly 2 lakh jobs are said to be at stake. The fact that a number of these pink slips are apparently being handed over to employees on short notice catching them completely off-guard makes matters worse.In one such incidence, a Bengaluru-based Tech Mahindra employee was reportedly asked - or rather instructed - to hang his boots as part of the company\\'s restructuring plans. He was literally instructed by an HR manager to put in his papers the next morning or else face the axe. Now on a regular day, and inside an IT company, one would expect an employee to be given a fair amount of time to look for alternatives. Only, this wasn\\'t the case at Tech Mahindra. To further cement the unfair treatment meted out to him, the employee managed to record his conversation with the HR and then went on to upload the same on Soundcloud. \"Cost optimisation is happening at the company and your name is part of that list. If you can put in papers we will be treating it as a normal exit with June 15 as last working day, if not, we will be sending you a termination letter,\" the HR executive is heard saying in the 6:45-minute long audio clip. When the employee dares to reason, the HR is heard re-instating what is supposedly a fact at Tech Mahindra, that the company reserves all rights to let the associates go whenever it wants, with the basic salary. The same is mentioned in the offer letter that the employees are asked to sign at the time of joining.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0', 'The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) roped in schoolchildren and kicked off its mega plantation drive on Saturday.As part of the programme, which will continue for the next 4-5 weeks, nearly 30,000 students of 51 NDMC schools planted saplings on their school premises and surrounding areas like parks, garden, along road sides and service lanes. The council officials say each student has to plant at least one sapling.When asked why trees are important, four-year-old Kashish, a kindergarten student of NP school in Lodhi Colony, said, ?Fruit and vegetables dete hain. (They give us fruits and vegetables).?NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar pointed out how a green drive can?t be a success unless it is a people?s movement. ?Not only NDMC as a civic agency, every stakeholder has to be a part of it. Be it little children, youngsters, their parents and senior citizens. All residents, market associations, ministers and MPs, expats of the different embassies and people working in the many offices in the council area have to take part in the drive. The idea is to systematically engage each and every stakeholder,? Kumar said.According to him, the push this year is to make NDMC truly a green city and make the 48% green cover to 50%.The council ? which looks after the Capital?s high-profile neighbourhoods housing the power elite, embassies, top markets and fancy restaurants ? plans to conduct weekly drives in big gardens, sides of wide roads, local parks and government offices and quarters.?We are focusing on improving the quality of the greenery, especially on both sides of the big roads. There is also a stress on local varieties, which will flourish in the city?s climate and soil with minimal water. We are also stressing on maintenance and mechanisation. We had sent our horticulture staff to Belgium, China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore to get international exposure,? the NDMC chairman said.Apart from planting ornamental, herbal, shrubs, 28,000 indigenous trees like sheesham, peepal, neem tress, the council also plans to plant fruit trees like mango and jamun during the drive.', 'More women gaining admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) was a welcome news. But the institute in Delhi has no room for them, literally. Due to space crunch, several students have been asked to stay in an adjacent building meant for associate professors. According to a senior IIT official, due to 30% increase in number of women students for undergraduate and masters courses, there is severe shortage of accommodation. As a temporary measure, many have been accommodated in facilities meant for associate professors. Sources said a few angry parents complained to HRD minister Prakash Javadekar claiming that students were asked to sleep on the mattress spread on the floor as cots were unavailable. IIT officials said they have placed order for cots and 30-40 of them will be made available from Saturday.?We have accommodated all undergraduate students in the hostel. Around 100 masters students have been allotted rooms in the adjacent building. It is a temporary arrangement,? said a senior IIT official. Officials said even in 2016, a few students were asked to stay in temporary accommodation but were soon allotted hostels. The number is significantly high this year. ?Most of them have been given mattresses till cots are made available,? the official said. The existing hostels for post-graduate students in IIT-Delhi, Kailash and Himadri, can accommodate 900 students and are fully occupied now.?We had not anticipated such an increase but we have provided cots and almirahs to some students. We will provide them soon to the students who got only mattresses as of now. They will dine with students in the dining area in the hostel,? said the official.The IITs have registered a better representation of women this year ? from 8% in 2016 to 9.3 % in 2017. Through JEE advanced, a total of 70 girl students were admitted in IIT-Delhi for undergraduate courses in 2016 and it rose to 94 this year. There has also been a corresponding increase in MTech, MSc and PhD courses. ?Construction of our new hostel will begin by December.

Back then they were looking for a girl for the part and couldn\\'t find one. Suddenly, Adi Sir [Aditya Chopra] called to say that there is this script called Side B Love. That was its title then.

India Today Tech has reached out to the company seeking more clarity on the issue and will update the piece once we have more information.As of the Freedom 251 itself, the company claims that it has so far delivered around 70,000 units of the Rs 251 smartphone, and will continue to do so, albeit a little differently. \"Delivery of Freedom 251 will be made by retailers who will get the products in turn from the distributors and they in turn from the company as is the standard practice in trade. In addition, as has been underpinned and re-clarified on several occasions, the sales are only on cash on delivery basis. The company is making efforts to deliver more Freedom 251 in recent months,\" it said. Â\\xa0That should explain why ringingbells.co.in wouldn\\'t open anymore, however, not entirely. This is because the only way to order (and luckily receive) a Freedom 251 was via the official website. Now that the website is down, there is no way for those who registered (for the device) to know their impending status. The company has launched a slew of other devices (feature phones, smartphones, TVs and power banks) in the meanwhile, and at least some of them are available from Amazon India. The future of the Freedom 251, however, remains as bleak as ever. Again, we\\'ve reached out to the company for a little more clarity and will update the piece as and when we get a response. Ringing Bells claims that it has so far delivered around 70,000 units of the Freedom 251 in states such as West Bengal, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, New Delhi, Punjab, J&K, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

The solve rate has gone up by 16.77 per cent.Senior officials believe that this could happen only because of the change in policing methods brought about by commissioner Amulya Kumar Patnaik.The official data also reveals that incidents of dacoity have gone down by 21.05 per cent, and this year Delhi Police managed to solve 93.33 per cent of the cases. Instances of robbery have gone down too. In 2016, up to May 15, as many as 2,177 such cases were reported, compared to 1,180 in the same period this year. Cops managed to solve 45.15 per cent of the cases in 2015, while the figure this year is 65.42 per cent.\\'IN THE FUTURE, CRIME RATE WILL GO DOWN\\'The Capital has often been tagged with the dubious distinction of being India\\'s most unsafe metropolitan city. Giving credit to foot patrolling and effective investigation by special teams formed in all districts, senior Delhi Police officials said, \"In the near future the crime rate will go down and whenever a case will be reported it will be solved.\" This year, 740 cases of rape were reported till May 15, compared to 802 in 2016. And cops have cracked 77.30 per cent of the cases reported this year. Senior officials added that one of the reasons behind the improving solve rate is promotions of cops and power of investigation granted to them.Patnaik, who took charge as Delhi\\'s police commissioner on January 31 this year, is the man behind the promotions as he believes that promoting cops will not only help in reducing pendency files but will also boost their morale, sources said. In 2016, as many as 18,702 personnel were promoted by granting \"special grade designation\". This includes 9,364 head constables to assistant sub-inspectors and 933 constables to head constables. A total of 51 inspectors were also promoted to ACP, 117 sub-inspectors to inspectors, 596 ASI to sub-inspectors. Not only this: 1,923 personnel were promoted for functional requirements under the comprehensive scheme. PATNAIK \\'VERY COMPETENT IN ADMINISTRATION AND INVESTIGATION\\'Patnaik, a 1985-batch IPS officer, will be on his post for the next three years. He was previously the special commissioner (administration) in Delhi Police.When he became the commissioner, Mail Today had reported that senior officers described Patnaik as someone who has a deep knowledge of policing and the law and order situation.\"He is very competent in administration and investigation. He will make police work on the ground,\" an official said in January.Since then, sources say the top cop has kept a tight vigil on crime trends and regularly conducts meetings with the district heads to guide them on how to curb offences and solve cases.Not only has the efficiency of solving heinous crimes improved but the number of street crimes cracked by cops has also gone up. Be it snatching, burglary or motor vehicle theft, this year Delhi Police managed to solve most cases.Around 33.82 per cent of snatching cases have been solved, compared to 19.28 per cent last year.In February, as reported by MAIL TODAY, Patnaik had formed core teams, special investigation teams and law and order research teams in every district to solve all the cases.Also, special trainings are being given for better policing. The law and order research team comprises officials till inspector rank. It helped the cops improve policing methods, said officials.ALSO READ | Delhi man plans surprise for wife, strangles her to death with clutch wire in park', \"The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) today asked a TADA court in Mumbai that Abu Salem, a convict in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case, be sentenced to life in prison.The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) court found Abu Salem, Mustafa Dossa, Firoz Abdul Rashid Khan, Tahir Merchant, Karimullah Khan, and Riyaz Siddique guilty of all charges in the case on June 16.The CBI's prosecutor today noted that since Salem was extradited from Portugal under section 34C of the Extradition Act, he can't be given capital punishment.However, the prosecutor said Salem deserved the death penalty.Section 34C stipulates that an individual extradited from a nation which doesn't sentence convicts to death, can only be put in jail for life for a crime punishable by the death penalty in India, the Hindustan Times reported.The defence's arguments will be heard tomorrow.

', ' Even as the debate over menstrual leave is causing a stir in the country, a Shiv Sena corporator wants it to be made mandatory. The corporator, Sheetal Mhatre, tabled a proposal in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), demanding that government, semi-government and private organisations grant leave to women employees on the first day of their periods. Mhatre?s notice of motion is likely to be discussed in the general body meeting next month. All 227 corporators pass resolutions moved in the general body meeting with consensus. If passed, the proposal will be sent to the municipal commissioner for his reply followed by the state government. Talking about her proposal, Mhatre said, ?Working women are under tremendous stress these days. In the olden days, women were asked to step away from her normal duties, but with nuclear families today that is also not possible.? She added, ?While we are equal to men, we must also respect the fact that we are physically different. Women undergo many hormonal changes that become difficult to cope with.? Taking a cue from countries such as Japan and Italy, an organisation based in Mumbai recently decided to  give off on the women an option to take off on the a paid leave on the first day of their period. The issue has caused a stir on social media with many objecting to the so-called ?privileged? leave. Experts from Akshara, a non-government organisation working for equal rights for women, however said that the proposal was not a great idea. Dr Nandita Shah, co-director at Akshara, said, ?Treating menstruation as a sickness is not right. Women have already proved that they can work even during their periods. If it is a discomfort for some women at times, it can treated as normal sick leave.? Shah also said that with menstrual leave becoming compulsory, employers will not be interested in hiring women.READ What?s the fuss around #FOP? Plenty, as India wakes up to the period leave policyMaharashtra launches free injectable contraceptive for women', 'It is a moment that is seared on to the consciousness of Frank Lampard and every Chelsea fan ? particularly those who were there. Bolton Wanderers away; 30Â\\xa0April 2005. Lampard surges around one opponent, cuts inside another and thrashes a low shot into the net.If Chelsea win, they win the league title. For the first time since 1955. And in their centenary year, too. Lampard has set them on their way and the celebrations that follow are frenzied. He is buried beneath a scrum of team-mates. Even some of the substitutes jump on.Lampard is not finished. On a quick break, he finds himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He walks the ball around him to make it 2-0. Game over. Chelsea are the champions. Lampard is a champion. Not bad for a player who they said would not make it to the top.He was not finished. It was the second major honour of his career, following on from the League Cup triumph in February of that year and Lampard would go on to claim 11 of them ? all with his beloved Chelsea, the club he joined from West Ham United in 2001. The highlight, surely, was the Champions League final in 2012, when he captained Chelsea, in the absence of the suspended John Terry, to the penalty shootout victory against Bayern Munich.Now, Lampard is finished. At the age of 38 and after 21 years in the professional game, he has decided to retire. He does so with three Premier League titles to his name; four FA Cups; two League Cups; the Champions League and the Europa League. In other words, the clean sweep at club level.With England, it never went to plan, although he is hardly the only player who can say that. He was excellent at Euro 2004, scoring three times as England reached the quarter-finals but his subsequent tournament appearances at the World Cups of 2006, 2010 and 2014 were disappointments.Lampard missed his penalty in the quarter-final shootout defeat against Portugal in 2006 and, four years later, his glorious shot in the lastÂ\\xa016 against Germany bounced off the crossbar and over the line ? except that the officials ruled it as no goal. It would have made the score 2-2. Instead, England slumped to a 4-1 defeat.In many respects, it summed up how Lampard?s international career, which yielded 106 caps and 29 goals, came down on the wrong side of the margins. It was shaped by his relationship in central midfield with Steven Gerrard, or the lack of one. The Lampard-Gerrard conundrum was debated endlessly.Nevertheless, Lampard goes down as a Premier League great and he owes it all to his phenomenal work ethic and mental toughness; the desire that he has always had to prove his worth ? and others wrong.?When Frank was a youngster, I can remember a lot of people saying: ?What?s all the fuss? He?s a good player but he isn?t that good,? says Tony Carr, the former West Ham academy director, under whom Lampard developed. ?He never got to play for England schoolboys and I can remember Harry Redknapp, the West Ham manager, asking me why Frank wasn?t playing for England youth, when he was a youth-team player at the club.?Harry rang the England coach, who was Dave Burnside, and Dave said: ?We know about him but we think we?ve got better.? That sort of thing was a fantastic spur for Frank. With his bloody?mindedness, his dedication, the way he constantly tried to improve himself ? he made himself the ultimate pro. I?ve got nothing but complete admiration for him.?As the tributes came in on Thursday, the one from Terry stood out. Lampard?s long-time Chelsea team?mate described him as a gentleman and a leader. But Terry also made reference to how Lampard had wrung every last drop from his talent. ?You were the best trainer by a million miles every single day, inspiring me and everyone at the club,? Terry wrote. ?You stayed out [after training] working on your finishing ? 20 goals a year wasn?t good enough for you; you wanted 25, 30 goals. I will miss you getting four cones and doing sprints after training ? setting the example for the academy kids.?Lampard is synonymous with consistency and durability; only Ryan Giggs and Gareth Barry have made more Premier League appearances than his 609 while his run of 164 consecutive matches remains a record for an outfield player. He read the game with intelligence ? this is a man who recorded one of Britain?s highest Mensa scores ? and it is questionable whether he got the credit he deserves for his exceptional short and long passing.In the end, though, Lampard was defined by his goals; the timing of the runs, the technique and the power of the execution. He says the two at Bolton were his best with the one he scored for Chelsea at Aston Villa in 2013, which took him past Bobby Tambling?s all-time record for the club, not far behind.When Lampard left Chelsea in 2014 to finish his career at Manchester City and New York City, he did so with 211 goals from 649 appearances for them. It is doubtful whether the mark will be overhauled. In terms of the Premier League, only Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney and Andy Cole have scored more than his 177 goals and they, of course, are strikers.His numbers are mind?boggling and Terry, Tambling and others have described him as Chelsea?s greatest player. His next move looks likely to be into coaching. Whatever he does, Lampard will give it his all.', 'Newcomer Kuldeep Yadav picked up four wickets on debut to help India skittle out Australia for 300 in their first innings on the opening day of the fourth and final Test in Dharamsala on Saturday.

(Ashwin breaks Steyn\\'s record)', 'In the wake of recent controversies where several filmmakers have locked horns with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), a fresh debate has been triggered by filmmaker Shyam Benegal meeting with the officials at the Information & Broadcasting Ministry. The filmmaker met the ministry officials to check the status of the report submitted by a special committee led by him in 2016, which suggested that CBFC should limit its functioning to issuing certificates to movies and not impose censoring.While Benegal is hopeful that government will push the much required revamping of the CBFC and introduce changes in the archaic Cinematograph Act 1952, we contacted him to for clarity on any deadline given by the ministry. He tells us, ?We submitted the report in two parts?in April and October last years?and they are yet to take any action. I?ve been after them for the last 10 days but I can?t talk much because I have sworn to maintain the confidentiality of the subject until the ministry itself reacts.?He adds, ?I?d urge you to get in touch with the Joint Secretary or the secretary of the ministry or even the minister Ms. Smriti Irani and ask them what happened to the report and why haven?t they taken any action on the proposed changes.?The committee has proposed amendments such as introducing a new category called ?adult with caution? and sub-dividing existing categories into UA 12+ and UA 15+ to make the content accessible to appropriate audience. If we don?t have a rating system in between UA and A, we will suggest cuts otherwise we can?t certify.Reacting to the points mentioned in the report, Pahlaj Nihalani, CBFC chairman says, ?What the Shyam Benegal report says, I don?t agree with that because he?s not demanding the right things. If we don?t have a rating system in between UA and A, so definitely we will suggest them cuts otherwise we can?t certify [the film].?With an underlined sarcasm, Nihalani adds, ?A wrong interpretation by some unknowledgeable people that CBFC is just a certification body, as along with that there?s an act and rulebook also, which you can?t forget.?While all this is still being debated upon, we asked film frat if it?s about time that censor board should be revamped and new changed be introduced.If certification is specifically categorized, audience can self-censor  what they?d like to consumeStating that it?s ?pathetically regressive? to have an appointed board deciding on creative cuts, filmmaker Homi Adajania opines, ?It?s bizarre that some pseudo-intellectual diktat can be passed allowing a screen kiss to linger for six seconds but not eight! What happens in those two seconds? It?s all just so freaking backward.? He adds, ?If certification is specifically categorized, audience can self-censor what they?d like to consume, knowing what the film?s rating stands for and through this they will not be offended by the content.?Director Ruchi Narain, whose animated film Hanuman ?Da Damdaar faced censorship issues, quips, ?It?s the simple truth. Government should govern. Reporters should report. Film makers should make films. Certification board should certify. If you start censoring everything, you turn blank and have nothing to say.?Ruling out any possibility that Bollywood can ever be free from censorship, filmmaker Hansal Mehta says it?s sad that there?s no will to actually bring about a change. ?I heard about this draft for a bill being proposed, which will be studied by the cabinet. But when will it be tabled in the Parliament? When will it actually go through?? asks Mehta.We?ll have to push our artistic boundaries in a way that we can work within the guidelines and parameters of CBFC?Every time there a furor around a film, there?s some spoken gesture that comes through but there?s no action. I have this sinking feeling that we?ll have to live with censorship that has existed since CBFC came into existence and Cinematograph Act was formed in 1952. So, we?ll have to push our artistic boundaries in a way that we can work within the guidelines and parameters of CBFC,? he adda.In support of Shyam Benegal committee report, film critic Omar Qureshi says, ?Censorship rules and regulations are as archaic as it gets and these new recommendations are an upgradation on the lines of the American association that has PG13 and PG18 and ?approved for all audiences? as per guidelines set for movies depending upon language and adult and violence quotient. And in any case, the word ?censor? is wrong. The body was always meant to guide and certify. Never censor. It reduces the freedom of expression to naught.

The same evening he took the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to stay at the helm in the state. The new ministers were sworn in on July 29.Of the 22 tainted ministers in the new cabinet, nine mentioned in their affidavits facing serious criminal cases against them. Two of Kumar?s party ministers even face attempt to murder charges under section 307 of the IPC against them. Many other ministers face cases of dacoity, theft, fraud and atrocities against them.Interestingly, the average income of a minister in the new cabinet is Rs 2.46 crore, even as the percentage of crorepati ministers dropped marginally this time as compared to Kumar?s previous government. While 79% ministers ? 22 ? were crorepatis in the GA government, 21 (72%) are crorepatis in the JD(U)-led NDA government.Labour resources minister and BJP MLA from Lakhisarai, Vijay Kumar Sinha, has properties worth Rs 15.50 crore, while urban development department minister and BJP MLA from Muzaffarpur Suresh Kumar has properties worth Rs 11 crore. Water resources and planning minister and JD(U) legislator from Munger, Rajiv Ranjan Singh, has properties worth Rs 5 crore. ', 'From Lalit K Jha Washington, Jan 27 (PTI) Two Indian snake hunters have been hired by Florida wildlife officials to get rid of Burmese pythons, which are wiping out small mammal populations driving some nearly to extinction in a tropical wetland in the US state. Masi Sadaiyan and Vaidivel Gopal, both in their 50s, from the Irula tribe of Tamil Nadu, are successful python hunters in India, and were brought in, along with two translators, to work with detection dogs earlier this month to track down and capture the giant snakes. In just eight days, they have surprised officals of Florida Fish and Wildlfe Conservation Commission (FWC) by bagging as many as 13 pythons, including a 16-foot-long female. A joint endeavour of FWC and University of Floridas Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFS), officials have described it as a \"unique project\". \"Since the Irula have been so successful in their homeland at removing pythons, we are hoping they can teach people in Florida some of these skills,\" said Kristen Sommers, section leader of the FWCs Wildlife Impact Management Section. \"We are working with our partners to improve our ability to find and capture pythons in the wild. These projects are two of several new efforts focused on the removal of these snakes,\" Sommers said. \"In their first eight days on the job, the Irula tribesmen ? world-renowned snake catchers from India ? removed 13 pythons, including four on their first visit to Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge on North Key Largo in partnership with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Traditionally, the main occupation of the Irula tribe has been catching snakes,\" a media release said. Officials said they are currently working with the Irula tribesmen to identify additional programmes to remove more nonnative pythons from Florida. The FWC and UF/IFAS have been collaborating with public land managers to identify environmentally sensitive areas that would benefit most from targeted python removal. Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge is one such area because of the federally-endangered Key Largo woodrat and many protected bird species that reside there.

I looked farther up and there was another tusk,? said Sparks.The Sparks family contacted Peter Houde, a professor at the New Mexico State University (NMSU) in the US.?A stegomastodon would look to any of us like an elephant,? said Houde.?For the several types of elephants that we have in the area, this is probably one of the more common of them. But they?re still very rare. This may be only the second complete skull found in New Mexico,? he said.After the family contacted Houde, the jaw and two pieces of tusk were taken to the Vertebrate Museum at NMSU.In May, the family joined a team of scientists who worked for about a week to carefully unearth the skull.Houde estimates the jaw weighs about 120 pounds and the entire skull as little as a tonne. While the skull may appear to be strong, it is quite delicate.?The upper part of the skull is deceiving. It?s mostly hollow and the surface of the skull is eggshell thin,? Houde said.?An extremely large skull would be very heavy for the animal if it didn?t have air inside it to lighten it up just like our own sinuses,? he said.?That makes the thing extremely fragile and the only thing holding it together is the sediment surrounding it,? he added.During the weeklong extraction process, 10 to 12 people helped at different times with the excavation of the stegomastodon skull.Researchers painstakingly brushed away the last bits of dirt from the skull and tusk and applied chemical hardeners to ensure the ancient bones remained intact.Acting like plastics, the chemicals harden and restore the strength that would otherwise be present in the bone as protein.After the skull was unearthed, the team carefully coated the fossil with plaster and placed wood braces to protect and support it.The skull was lifted from the dig site by a front-end loader and placed on a flatbed truck for the trip back to the university.While the process to study and reconstruct the skull, jaw and tusks will take years to complete, Houde said that the stegomastodon fossil will eventually go on display. ', 'Two persons were injured as a group of residents opened fire at a neighbourhood in Loni town of Ghaziabad on the wee hours of Friday, when a local panchayat was trying to settle an alleged ?rape? case.According to Loni police, a 23-year-old married man, identified as Arif, entered the house of a 20-year-old woman during the wee hours on Friday and allegedly raped her. The family members were asleep on the roof of the rented house, when the incident happened. Arif was caught when tenants of neighbouring houses woke up hearing the noise.After the man was caught, the locals gathered to discuss the issue, as there were speculations that Arif and the woman were in a relationship and he had entered the house with the woman?s consent. While a local panchayat discussed whether to get the two married or to lodge a police complaint against Arif, one of the neighbours rang up the police. ?Attracting police attention to the incident led to resentment among the locals. The neighbour who rang up the police was rebuked by the group holding the panchayat. In retaliation, his family members pelted stones over the group,? said Loni circle officer Durgesh Kumar Singh.Meanwhile, the police arrived at the spot and took the woman and Arif to the station. Following this, some people holding the panchayat insisted that the woman?s family should be allowed to vacate their rented accommodation. The woman?s landlord, Mohammad Inam, took offence to this suggestion and allegedly opened fire over the members.During the firing, two persons ?Dilshad, 60, and Rehan, 20 ? were injured and had to be rushed to hospital. The police said they arrested the landlord Inam, his associates Naeem, Naseeb and Yameen in connection with the firing incident.?We are still investigating what happened at the woman?s house. Arif has been booked for rape after her family forwarded a complaint. We have lodged a second FIR, based on a complaint forwarded by the family of the two injured persons. Seven persons were booked for attempt to murder,? Singh said.', 'A Pakistan app-based taxi service has launched an unusual add on, offering passengers the chance to share their ride with a marriage matchmaker.Users in Pakistan woke on Wednesday to an unexpected notification from Careem -- an Uber-like taxi hailing app popular in Muslim countries: Have a ?rishta aunty? accompany you during your ride.Rishta aunties, as marriage matchmakers are known in South Asia, keep detailed records of eligible men and women -- from education level and salary, to height, weight and skin tone -- and will set you up with your future spouse, for a fee.Usually portrayed in popular culture as bespectacled women with a clipboard of names and an ancient Nokia mobile, the aunties have had an update thanks to Careem.

The partys Delhi in-charge Sanjay Jha announced it an event where few district-level Aam Aadmi Party workers, mainly from east Delhi, joined JD(U), accusing the AAP of neglecting Poorvanchalis in MCD ticket distribution. Jha said JD(U) aims to tap the \"discontent\" among the AAPs poorvanchali voters base. He said the Poorvanchalis here have been \"let down\" by the Arvind Kejriwal government despite having extended every possible backing to it over the last two years. \"Nitish Kumar will address two rallies, one each in north and south Delhi after Holi. The first list of our candidates will be out within a week,\" he said. BJPs decision to appoint Bhojpuri artiste Manoj Tiwari as its Delhi unit chief is also being seen as an attempt to woo the Poorvanchali community, comprising the people from the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The Delhi unit of JD(U) was constituted during Kumars visit here on December 3 last year. Jha brushed aside Kumars perceived closeness with Kejriwal, saying JD(U) will work for expanding its base and work towards ensuring \"fair\" representation of the Poorvanchali population. AAP had supported JD(U) in the 2015 Bihar Assembly polls and the two parties often cooperate in Parliament.

If it doesn?t, that comedy isn?t wrong. It?s just not suitable for you,? the Canadian internet sensation recently told AFP on the sidelines of a trip to New Delhi as a UN goodwill ambassador.Last week comedy group All India Bakchod were put under investigation for defamation and publishing obscene material online after a social media post poking fun at Modi.  The troupe posted a photograph of a Modi look-alike alongside an image of the real prime minister?s face superimposed with a dog?s features using a Snapchat filter.The post went viral, but sparked a backlash from Modi supporters. AIB later deleted the post.?Comedy is very subjective... and the best thing you can do is promote what you love, don?t bash what you hate,? said Singh, who met students in the Indian capital and in Madhya Pradesh state as a UNICEF ambassador. ?Comedy is the best way to express views.?The child of Indian migrants, Singh has more than 11 million YouTube followers and is one of the channel?s biggest earners.The 28-year-old has made her name with video rants, making fun of imaginary Punjabi parents and anti-sexism sketches that take on themes such as ?Why bras are horrible? and ?If boys got their periods?.

Then on Tuesday morning Trump will meet Abbas in Bethlehem before flying on to Rome.Speaking at his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, ahead of Trump?s arrival, Netanyahu said: ?I will discuss with President Trump ways to strengthen our primary and steadfast ties with the United States. We will improve our security ties, which we are strengthening on a daily basis. We will also discuss ways to advance the peace.?The visit will take place under tight security with about 10,000 police securing the Israeli part of the visit, which will be accompanied by road closures. Trump will spend a single night in a suite in the King David hotel protected by glass capable of withstanding a rocket-propelled grenade and a poison gas attack. The visit comes at a tense time ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War in early June ? which for Palestinians marks five decades of occupation ? and amid a continuing hunger strike by hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails that has prompted sometimes violent demonstrations on the West Bank.Trump?s problems at home are also seen by some as having cast a pall over the proceedings, with Dan Shapiro, the former US ambassador to Israel under Barack Obama, predicting: ?I think the trip?s in a lot of jeopardy [in] being able to be productive because of all the chaos and controversy that?s going on in Washington.? Despite the signs posted in Jerusalem neighbourhoods welcoming Trump as ?a friend of Zion? and calling on hims to ?make Israel great?, his visit is also causing anxieties for many on Israel?s right for whom Trump?s election was seen initially as the cause for unbridled celebration. Since his inauguration on 20 January, those same rightwingers fear that Trump has drifted towards an ever more conventional US foreign policy position on the peace process.Far from moving the US embassy to Jerusalem on his first day in office ? as he promised ? Trump has kicked that issue into the long grass while expressing a sometimes garbled objection to Israeli settlement building.That has seen David Friedman, the controversial and pro-settler new US ambassador to Israel who arrived last week, move quickly to reassure Netanyahu?s government that Trump remains as firmly committed to Israel as ever, even as he suggested that no announcement on the US embassy would be made until after Trump?s visit.The messaging on the Israel-Palestine peace process has also been downbeat, with one US official telling Haaretz on Sunday that the height of Trump?s ambitions for his ?ultimate deal? right now appears to involve no more than encouraging the two sides to play nicely to create conditions for direct talks.?The president has made a general statement regarding his view on settlements and he hopes the Israeli government takes it into account,? the official said. ?He was also pretty direct with President Abbas regarding what they need to do regarding incitement and the payments to families of terrorists. He has been quite clear about that and he will be clear about that during the visit.?Instead, the expectation will be that Trump will neither outline a vision for a framework for the peace process nor any concrete steps. What noises that have emerged from reported leaks about Trump?s plans to advance peace suggest an implausible mishmash of ideas ? including the idea that Israel be allowed to continue settlement building during talks.On the Israeli side the most significant outcome is a proposal for improving the economic quality of life for Palestinians on the West Bank, including longer opening hours for the Allenby Bridge crossing to Jordan, more building permits in the so-called area C and suggestions for new industrial zones on the West Bank.Lacking any clear prospects for a breakthrough, the runup to the visit has been dominated by mini ? and sometimes concocted ? controversies including the comment by a US official telling Netanyahu?s office that the Western Wall was not in Israeli territory.Trump will, however, become the first US president to visit the wall, a fact that was being spun last week by Jonathan Schanzer of the rightwing US Foundation for Defence of Democracies as a pro-Israel step.?I think that if Trump himself goes to the Western Wall and does it with Israeli officials, even Israeli security, there?s going to be very little argument over who controls it ? certainly [when] going there to acknowledge it as a Jewish holy site,? said Schanzer.On the Palestinian side, officials appear content that the worst predictions regarding Trump on the Middle East ? fuelled by his own campaign rhetoric ? have not materialised. ?We?re happy that, contrary to initial expectations, the Trump administration has been willing to listen,? one official said. ?Our readout is that Trump was surprised by Abbas?s declaration of his willingness to make peace, having being told the opposite by some of his advisers.?', 'Australia\\'s professional cricketers rejected a pay offer from the sport\\'s governing body on Friday, saying the proposal was \"a win for cricket administrators but a loss for cricket\".The already protracted and sometimes rancorous negotiations between the players\\' union and Cricket Australia (CA) precede the expiry of the current five-year deal, which runs out at the end of June.CA released their proposal last month, offering large salary increases, particularly for women, but breaking with the 20-year model of a fixed percentage of revenue from the game going to the cricketers.That break and a number of other factors proved unacceptable to the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA), who laid out a counter-proposal in a statement on Friday.\"The ACA on behalf of Australia\\'s cricketers has today rejected Cricket Australia\\'s pay and conditions proposal,\" read a statement.\"The ACA also expresses frustration that what should be a relatively simple and good faith negotiation has not proceeded in this way.\"The fact that CA has, despite various attempts to do so, produced no logical reason to break the successful partnership model and longstanding relationship with players, leaves the players unclear as to CA\\'s objectives.\"', \"The Shiv Sena and its estranged ally the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are locked in a close contest in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, an exit poll conducted by Axis-My India for India Today shows.

And, while this funding round provides the fuel we need need to reach that goal, we have to continue growing our business with careful considerations to costs,\" he said in a mail shot-off to his employees after raising USD 1.4 billion from Tencent Holdings, Microsoft Corp and eBay Inc. \"I look forward to your continued support,\" he added. The announcement comes in the wake of Flipkart, Indias largest e-commerce player, looking to cut cost by its plan to sack at least 700 employees, or over 3 per cent of its workforce, to compete with rivals like Amazon and Snapdeal. The funding announcement comes in the wake of Flipkart, being in the eye of a storm in recent times for lowering of valuation, which prompted them to make several changes in its business model, including raising margins, it charges from sellers. A host of Flipkarts investors had marked down their valuation estimates by up to 39 per cent in the recent past. At its peak, Flipkart was valued at over USD 15 billion (roughly Rs 1,00,830 crore). Giving reasons for the significance of the latest funding, Binny Bansal said it is the largest in the companys 10-year history and also in Indias internet sector. Bansal also said it provides solid growth capital so that the company can cement and extend its lead in Indias e-commerce market, and its valuation remains healthy and in double-digits, reflective of the current business and global economy. \"I am particularly excited from the strong confidence global tech giants have shown in our abilities. It is just an acknowledgement of the strides we have taken in improving peoples lives, it is also an endorsement of the opportunities ahead,\" he said. Bansal said the deals that the company has struck are important for them as e-commerce space accounts for less than two per cent of all retail in India and the potential for online retail alone is about USD 100 billion. \"As I have said before, the potential is vast and we have only just scratched the surface. E-commerce accounts for less than two per cent of all retail in India and the potential for online retail alone is about USD 100 billion. Which is why these deals are particularly important for all of us,\" he said. Bansal said these partnerships bring in a lot more than funds and set the company to compete more aggressively through innovations, which will enable them to collaborate deeply with eBay on cross-border trade and ensure their customers have a wider selection of international products to choose from. \"Tencent, one of the largest internet companies in the world, and Microsoft also join us as strategic investors,\" he added.

This is, in his own words, keeping the \\'convenience of the force in mind\\'.From being deployed for the conduct of elections to supporting counter-insurgency operations to aiding the police, the 239-battalion strong CRPF is among the most extensively deployed forces.WHY NO FAREWELL PARADEIn his first reaction, K Durga Prasad, a 1981 batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer said, \"As such the CRPF is stretched. Then is the additional responsibility of ongoing elections. In this, a farewell parade would have meant that my personnel would be committed for an extended period to duties which are ceremonial in nature\". Instead, \"I visited my troops where they are, heard them and am trying to address their issues\", he said. Travelling over weekends, clearing files till late in the evening in office and camping for night halts between troop locations is indeed a norm for the present DG. He asked his staff to arrange a simple Guard of Honour to mark the end of his career. Â\\xa0Durga Prasad enjoys the reputation of being a hands-on leader with his ear to the ground. From taking the Maoists head-on in united Andhra Pradesh as the leader of \\'Greyhounds\\' force, he also held charge of the elite Special Protection Group (SPG) between November 2011 and November 2014.

However, forces like the CRPF have almost junked this principle. Rest, recuperation and training have been reduced merely to concepts on paper, say insiders. \"From a 50 per cent divide into hard and soft areas, the CRPF is more than 80 per cent into hard areas. Where is the room for respite?\", asked an informed source. DURGA PRASAD\\'S MOVE WELCOMEDAn officer of the CRPF, who has previously organised farewell parades termed Durga Prasad\\'s decision a \\'welcome move\\'. He recounted, \"For about a month, nearly 1,000 troops pooled in from all across the country march up and down in practice for the farewell parade at the CRPF training academy near Gurugram. In comparison, a Guard of Honour will involve not more than 100 troops\". DC Dey is a highly-regarded veteran, who retired as the Additional Director General of the CRPF.

Among all the captains who have led India for more than 20 Test matches, Kohli has the highest win percentage. In 27 Tests, he has 17 wins with 62.96 win percentage.

He wrote to the EC claiming that \"our experts\" will prove that the voting machines can be tampered with. \"I challenge the ECI to give us 72 hours to prove it,\" he said in the note.

The EVMs and VVPATs kept in reserve also go through the stringent protocol of first level checking, randomisation and loading of symbols during the candidates setting in the presence of representatives of candidates and political parties. Hence, the VVPATs that were sent to Bhind had the previous symbols loaded from Uttar Pradesh,\" it said.EC said, \"This is a standard protocol and there was nothing amiss in this.

', 'An Airbnb host who canceled a woman?s reservation using a racist remark has been ordered to pay $5,000 in damages for racial discrimination and take a course in Asian American studies.Dyne Suh, a 26-year-old law clerk, had booked Tami Barker?s mountain cabin in Big Bear, California, for a skiing weekend with friends in February, but Barker canceled the reservation by text message minutes before they arrived,stating: ?I wouldn?t rent it to u if u were the last person on earth? and ?One word says it all. Asian?.This is the first time an Airbnb host has been penalized for racial discrimination under a landmark agreement between the San Francisco-headquartered accommodation marketplace and the California department of fair employment and housing (DFEH), announced earlier this year. The agreement allows the regulator to test and penalize Airbnb hosts for racial bias. In addition to paying monetary damages and taking a college-level course in Asian American studies, Barker must agree to comply with anti-discrimination laws, make a personal apology to Suh, participate in a community education panel and volunteer with a civil rights organization.?We were thinking pretty creatively with this agreement,? said Kevin Kish, director of DFEH. ?The law tends to be backwards-looking, focusing on compensating people for harm. We?re interested in remedies that repair harm and transform relationships.?Suh booked Barker?s place for a long weekend with her fiance in February 2017 a month in advance for $250 a night. When Suh later asked if it was OK to bring two friends and two dogs along, Barker said it was fine but the group would need to pay an additional $50 a night, according to screenshots of their text messages. On the day of the booking, the foursome drove for hours in the rain and snow to Big Bear. Minutes away from the house, Suh texted Barker to let them know they were close and to confirm the cost of the stay. According to Suh, Barker then denied she ever agreed to having two extra guests and canceled the reservation, despite Suh sending her screenshots of their earlier agreement.When Suh said she?d complain to Airbnb about the racist remark, Barker replied: ?It?s why we have Trump ? and I will not allow this country to be told what to do by foreigners.?In an emotional video immediately after the incident, Suh said: ?I just feel so hurt. People thought: ?Oh, with the election of President Obama racism is over in this country.? No, it?s very much alive, it exists and it could happen to anyone.??It stings that after living in the US for over 23 years this is what happens. No matter if I follow the law ... no matter how well I treat others, it doesn?t matter. If you?re Asian, you?re less than human and people can treat you like trash.?After Suh complained, Airbnb carried out its own investigation and banned Barker from the platform.Suh also complained to DFEH, leading to a separate investigation, mediation and an agreement between the two parties, negotiated last week. The idea of making the host attend the Asian American studies course came out during mediation sessions. ?A lot of times when we see bias incidents it involves a lack of understanding of the experiences and histories of a particular group of people,? Kish said. ?This was a creative way to address that core underlying cause of the bias.??We want there to be strong anti-discrimination protections and preventions of harm, but we recognize that the world isn?t divided into good guys and bad guys. Humans have biases and we also need to recognize that humans change.?Barker?s lawyer Edward Lee said in a statement that his client was ?regretful for her impetuous actions and comments? but pleased to have resolved the matter with Suh and the DFEH ?in a manner that can hopefully bring a positive outcome out of an unfortunate incident?.Airbnb allowed the DFEH to regulate it for racial bias following a 10-month investigation based on a growing number of reports suggesting hosts regularly refuse to rent to guests due to their race, a problem exposed in 2016 under the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack.Until that point, Airbnb, like other ?sharing economy? companies including Uber and Instacart, had repeatedly resisted industry regulations, arguing that it was a ?platform? and not subject to local laws and requirements that apply to similar businesses. Under the agreement, Airbnb allows the government to test for racial discrimination by hosts in California who have been subject to discrimination complaints and have three or more listings. The ?fair housing testing? echoes the process DFEH investigators have used in the traditional rental market where black and white applicants, with otherwise identical backgrounds, are both sent to try and secure a lease from a landlord. With Airbnb, investigators can set up fake accounts and make reservation requests to hosts to see if they are discriminating.

The Washington-based financial institution predicted India?s economy would grow by a ?still robust? 7% in the fiscal year to March 2017 ? a 0.6% drop from its earlier forecast but still the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.It attributes the fall to November?s decision to recall all 1,000 and 500 rupee currency bills from circulation, a surprise demonetisation move intended to weed out untaxed wealth, hasten the digitisation of India?s economy and disrupt terrorist and other criminal networks. ?Continued tailwinds from low oil prices and solid agricultural output [were] partly offset by challenges associated with the withdrawal of a large volume of currency in circulation and subsequent replacement with new notes,? the World Bank said on Wednesday.Demonetisation has suffocated the vast informal economy, which employs up to 80% of Indians, but the World Bank said the impact of the policy was likely to be short term. ?India is expected to regain its momentum, with growth rising to 7.6% in fiscal year 2018-19 and strengthening to 7.8% in fiscal year 2019-20,? the bank said.Automobile industry data also released on Wednesday showed the largest fall in sales in 16 years. Nearly 300,000 fewer vehicle were purchased last month than in December 2015, a drop of 19%, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.Sales of two-wheelers ? which require less paperwork to buy and are more popular in rural areas, so are more likely to be bought in cash ? fell by 22%, the steepest rate since Siam began collecting data in 1997.Property sales also came to a complete standstill, according to a report by property consultants Knight Frank India. Sales fell by 44% across eight major Indian cities between October and December 2016, compared with the same period in 2015, the report said.Delhi was particularly badly hit, with sales in the capital slumping by more than 50%, and 73% fewer new residential developments being launched than in the last quarter of 2015. ?The effect of demonetisation on all segments of the real estate sector across all markets has been fairly brutal to say the least,? said Shishir Baijal, the chairman of Knight Frank India.Speaking at the Vibrant Gujarat summit on Wednesday, the Indian finance minister, Arun Jaitley, continued to defend demonetisation, linking the policy to the goods and services tax the government is aiming to introduce in April. ?The combination of a more digitised economy with a more efficient tax system ... will make our economy look much cleaner and bigger,? he said.Jaitley said the rupee recall was ?a major step toward integration of [the] informal economy with the more formal economy?. He said: ?This itself is going to increase the transactions which are covered within the banking system, transactions which may lead to higher [tax] revenue in the future.?', \"Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon, who were said to have been dating for about a year now, seem to have called it quits. If the grapevine is to be believed, the actors have finally broken up.A report in BollywoodLife quotes a source as saying that the couple has parted ways because of the differences that had cropped up between them. While Kriti had become too clingy for her own good, says the report, Sushant's mood swings and temperament were getting a bit difficult to deal with.Sanon and Rajput apparently realised that and have parted ways now.Over the last one year, even though gossip mills have never stopped churning out stories about their relationship, Sushant and Kriti have been extremely tight-lipped about their relationship. The two actors were on the sets of their upcoming film Raabta when Cupid struck. Sushant parted ways with his longtime girlfriend Ankita Lokhande right before diving into the relationship with Kriti Sanon. If reports from back then are anything to go by, it was Kriti Sanon's growing proximity to Sushant that led to the rift between Ankita and him.On February 14 this year, Sushant was at Karan Johar's Singles' Party too, leading many to deduce that the actor was indeed single.ALSO READ: Did Kriti Sanon dirty-dance with Sushant Singh Rajput? Sanon responds \", 'If a picture is worth a thousand words, this one tells much more than that.A photograph of a group of primary school students studying in a toilet instead of a classroom in Neemuch district belies the tall claims of the Madhya Pradesh government about its efforts to improve education in the state. The students are being forced to study in a disused toilet because there is no school building. The primary school run by a single teacher is not situated in a remote area but at Mokhampura village which is only 35 km away from the Neemuch district headquarters. Shockingly, the local MLA is not even aware that such a school exists in his constituency, though the officials of the state education department acknowledge the appalling situation. The school was set up in 2012. For a year, the school had functioned out of a rented room. Now, that?s not available.A photograph of the school which has 34 children clearly shows that the room in which they are studying is a toilet that was built by the government. If that?s not bad enough, a few goats are sometimes tied in the toilet ? perhaps to prevent them from getting wet in the rain. School teacher Kailash Chandra says that he has been forced to take classes in the toilet because there is no school building. ?When the weather is fine in summer and winter, the classes are held under a tree, but now the earth is wet so I cannot hold the classes under a tree and am forced to use the toilet,? he told HT.Kailash Chandra said that it is not as if the higher-ups have not been informed. ?I have informed them of the condition a number of times over the years, but no one is paying any attention,? he said. But Manasa BJP MLA Kailash Chawla simply refused to acknowledge that there was any school in his constituency where children were studying in a toilet. However, the district education office K C Sharma said that he had written to the state education department about the situation and had sent proposal for construction of a school building.', 'Airlines have no authority to impose flying ban on anybody, including parliamentarians, and the law of the land should take its course, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman PJ Kurien said on Thursday.The remarks came after SP member Naresh Agrawal raised the issue of recent flying ban imposed by major domestic airlines, including state-owned Air India.Agrawal wanted to know if the airlines could impose such restrictions. According to him, such an action was a breach of privilege of the Members of Parliament.To this, Kurien said agreed that Agrawal has raised a ?valid point? that if any MP has committed a crime or something against the law, the law of the land should take its course.?Airlines are not given the authority to punish anybody. I think the government should take note of it.?MPs are also citizens ... if they commit a crime or mistake, the law of the land should take recourse to it,? the deputy chairman said.He further said ?it is a punishment imposed on an MP for some crime...This cannot be done. This is not a thing to be punished by airlines?.Congress MP Anand Sharma suggested to the deputy chairman that the word ?crime? should be replaced with ?violation?.However, Kurien said if a person beats up someone, it is a crime.Different airlines on Wednesday lifted the flying ban on TDP lawmaker JC Diwakar Reddy after ?urgent? notices from the court to the government and the aviation regulator DGCA on the lawmaker?s plea against the action of domestic carriers.On June 15, Reddy got into a verbal spat with IndiGo ground staff at Visakhapatnam airport and threw a printer kept at the airline counter after he was informed that boarding for his flight to Hyderabad had closed.Reddy was the second MP after Shiv Sena?s Ravindra Gaikwad who was banned from flying domestic airlines. A flying ban was imposed on Gaikwad in March this year after he repeatedly hit an Air India officer with slippers for not providing him a business class seat on an all-economy flight.The ban was lifted after a fortnight following an undertaking from him that he would desist from such conduct in future.

Today morning, Mattoo was trapped for more than eight hours with two other local Lashkar militants in a joint operation conducted by Army, Jammu and Kashmir Police and CRPF to nab the terrorists. One militant has been apprehended by the security forces. A joint team of Army, J-K police and CRPF cordoned off Arwani village on specific input about presence of Lashkar militants in the area today morning. As the cordon was being laid some youth assembled near the area and started pelting stones on security forces which resulted in clashes.Junaid Mattoo was involved in a day light attack on a police van in which three policemen including an officer was killed last year. Mattoo's involvement is also suspected in the killing of a policeman in Kulgam area of South Kashmir on Thursday afternoon.RS 10 LAKH BOUNTY Mattoo was believed to be active for the past two years and carried a bounty of Rs 10 lakh on his head.Intelligence sources said that search operation is still ongoing but have been hampered by stone-pelters who are targeting the security forces from different sides.Police said that Junaid Mattoo is the third top militant who has been killed after Burhan Wani since last year. Buran Wani's close aid Sabzar Ahmad Bhat was the second militant who was killed in an encounter on May 27 last month.According to intelligence information, Mattoo had joined militancy at the age of 18. He was put in the list of 12 most wanted militants in the Valley right now by the Army. Earlier on Thursday, two policemen were killed in two separate attacks by militants in the Kashmir Valley. Militants attacked a police party in the Hyderpora area of the city, at around 9.30 pm, by firing indiscriminately at a patrol party.Two cops were injured in the attack and were rushed to 92 Base Hospital of the Army.

', 'Delhi may join the elite club of cities with water taxi services by June end as the Centre?s Yamuna Water Taxi project to ferry tourists and public from Palla (Delhi-Haryana border) to Wazirabad is moving as per schedule.The service aims to promote tourism and reduce travel time between Wazirabad and Fatehpur Jat to 45 minutes. The distance between two points is nearly 20 kilomertres but due to poor public transport connectivity and heavy traffic movement  on the stretch (it connects the national capital to Haryana) , it takes 3.5 hours to cover the distance. Initially, only three of the five boarding points will open. The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has been appointed to implement the project and the process to procure vessels and develop infrastructure is already underway. The authority has moved a plea seeking environmental clearance from the National Green Tribunal (NGT).Amitabh Verma, chairman of IWAI, said as no permanent structure will be constructed, the authority hopes it will get a nod from the environment watchdog.  ?Things are very much on the track. Tenders for dredging, three passenger vessels, and jetties have been floated. Hopefully, by the end of June, we will start the ferry service in the city,? he said.The decision came after a feasibility study was done to identify a suitable stretch of the river for navigation and development of water transport facilities. After this, Delhi water minister Kapil Mishra along with the officials of IWAI, irrigation and flood control department and Delhi Jal Board (DJB), conducted a site inspection in July 2016. Experts disapproveEnvironmentalists are not amused with the idea and said the river does not have enough water round the year to survive such activities on a large scale. Manoj Misra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, said the water available on the stretch is meant to be used for drinking purposes and this arrangement should not be disturbed. ?This will affect the biodiversity along the river. If one wants to use small-hand rowing boats for leisure, it makes sense but water taxis will be useless,? he said.Environmentalist Vikram Soni, a professor at Centre for Theoretical Physics, Jamia Millia Islamia, said the plan does not seem feasible because the river does not have enough water except for the three months during monsoon. ?This will lead to destruction of the flood plain. They should not touch it but make efforts to save it for future generations,? he said.Authorities optimisticAfter the feasibility study, it was found that the stretch is suitable for the implementation of one of the priority projects of road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari. ?Yamuna upstream, which is almost 22 kms from Wazirabad to Palla, is less polluted and has the ?required depth? for navigation. The study said that water taxi and recreation activities are the most feasible and environmentally sustainable for this stretch. The initiative will help keep burden off the roads to some extent,? added Verma.If the plan is implemented successfully, the authorities are optimistic that it will pave the way for introduction of more water recreational activities or sports in Delhi and the Centre?s ambitious Delhi-Agra steamer service through Agra Canal project. ?Water sports are quite common and popular abroad. This will not only help boost tourism but also facilitate to rejuvenate the river by sensitising the youth about the importance of the river,? he said.', 'Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, who has been banned from flying by several airlines after he assaulted an Air India staffer on March 23, reached Delhi on Wednesday via a chartered flight, according to sources.Shiv Sena is all set to create ruckus in Parliament on Thursday to push for its demand to revoke the flying ban against its MP Ravindra Gaikwad. The chartered flight by which Gaikwad flew in to Delhi is believed to have been provided by another Shiv Sena MP Rajkumar Dhoot. Sources say Gaikwad will be reaching Parliament on April 6. Shiv Sena is expected to create ruckus in Parliament against the ban imposed on him.Â\\xa0 Sena MPs had approached Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju seeking his intervention into the matter, but they failed to get any assurance from him. SHIV SENA THREATENS TO CREATE RUCKUSShiv Sena MP Anand Adsul, while speaking in the Zero Hour on Wednesday, said that no one was listening to his party. \"Just because we are in the government does not imply we cannot create ruckus\", he threatened.Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0Adsul will move an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha on April 6 on the issue of blacklisting of Gaikwad by airlines and the government\\'s alleged failure to take action against them. If sources are to be believed, Shiv Sena is going to raise this issue prominently once Gaikwad reaches Parliament. Despite trying hard to get the government to lift the travel ban, Sena has not found any success yet. It seems the BJP is, rightly so, avoiding backing the Shiv Sena on an issue that has evoked so much nationwide outrage.Gaikwad, who hails from Osmanabad in Maharashtra, had allegedly hit an Air India staffer 25 times with a slipper on board a Pune-Delhi flight. This prompted Air India to ban him and other airlines followed suit with the result that he had to travel back to Maharashtra by August Kranti Rajdhani Express after he couldn\\'t book an air ticket on any carrier.GAIKWAD FAKED HIS NAME TO GET FLIGHT TICKETThe aggrieved Air India staffer also lodged two FIRs against Gaikwad in Delhi, investigation into which is still on. Gaikwad tried to fly 4 times even under false identities, but his ticket could not be processed. Facing scathing criticism over the incident, the Shiv Sena had earlier assured that it would reprimand Gaikwad, but that never happened. In fact, the party began defending his action soon after. Senior leaders of the party think that they are being cornered by the BJP on this issue as they have found no support from anywhere. This has prompted the Sena to resort to an aggressive and unruly show of strength, and Parliament is likely to witness uproarious scenes over the issue on Thursday.Also read | Slippergate: Shiv Sena to protest in Parliament if MP Ravindra Gaikwad\\'s flying ban is not liftedAlso read | Grounded MP Gaikwad tweaked name 4 times to book Air India tickets', 'New Delhi, May 2 (PTI) Tata Teleservices has fired between 500 and 600 employees to tide over difficult times in the hyper-competitive telecom market. As many as 500-600 employees have been impacted by the lay offs in sales and other related functions, two people familiar with the matter said. The lay-offs are across locations, they said, adding that the severance package being offered to the employees impacted by the decision is one months salary for every year of service. An e-mail sent to Tata Teleservices did not elicit a response. Sources in the company said that these are challenging times for the telecom industry. \"What most of the operators including Tata Telservices are doing is workforce rationalisation, to stay competitive in line with the needs of the market,\" they added. The lay-offs comes at a time when the telecom industry has been witnessing an intense tariff war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio, whose disruptive positioning in the market has left most of the telcos bleeding. The telecom operators are facing tremendous pressure on revenue and profitability even as the industrys debt has soared to nearly Rs 4.6 lakh crore.

If the Yamuna was so fragile and pure, they should have stopped the World Culture Festival,? said Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in a statement issued on Tuesday. The tribunal had allowed the festival on March 11-13, 2016, saying that as the matter was ?fait accompli?, they could not ban it. The three-day World Cultural Festival of Art of Living soon grabbed headlines for allegedly polluting and harming the ecosystems at the Yamuna floodplains.An interim environment compensation of Rs5 crore was imposed on the foundation for its alleged ?environment damaging activities? by the NGT while efforts were made to ascertain the exact cost of the damage.?World over, cultural programmes are held on riverbanks. The whole idea was to bring awareness to save the river. The Art of Living that has rejuvenated 27 rivers, planted 71 million trees, revived several ponds is being projected as destroying a dead river.

An expert panel, headed by Shashi Shekhar, secretary of ministry of water resources, submitted a report to the NGT, stating that it would take more than Rs 42 crore and at least 10 years to rehabilitate the floodplain after the damage caused by the three-day festival in March 2016.?I invite all honest environmentalists to study the case and unveil the truth,? he said.', 'Usually soft-spoken, actor Tiger Shroff says that he is ?over-protective? beyond imagination when it comes to his sister Krishna Shroff. ?If you ask me, obviously I?m the kind of guy who just wants to wrap his sister in a blanket, because I am an over-protective brother,? says Tiger. ?I know that after saying this, people will react and say, ?Oh, he?s a sexist,? and I?ll be called all sorts of names.

The impact of the collision was so strong that both Nishith and Ravi Chandra, who was the son of businessman MM Krishna, died on the spot.According to initial reports, the duo was on their way back home after attending a function when their speeding Benz car (TS07 FK7117) crashed into a metro pillar at Road No. 36 in Jubilee Hills.THE VICTIMS DECLARED BROUGHT DEADBoth the victims were rushed to the Apollo Hospital where they were declared brought dead. Nishith was one of the directors of the Narayana Education Group.He is survived by his parents and two sisters. The body will be shifted to Nellore after a post-mortem and the funeral will be conducted on Thursday. Telangana Minister T Harish Rao, apart from other VIPs and VVIPs, visited the hospital and consoled the family.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, leader of Opposition YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, and several ministers and MLAs of both Telugu State Andhra And Telangana expressed grief over Nishith's death.Meanwhile, it has been learnt that the vehicle involved in today's crash was earlier issued challans thrice for overspeeding this year - twice at Himayathsagar and once at Nehru Outer Ring Road of Hyderabad.Also read | West Bengal: 2 dead in mishap at IISCO plant after molten steel falls on labourers\", 'For years, poverty along with the cultural bent to favour boys has led to Indian parents abandoning babies in dumpsters, hedges, train tracks and even rivers or lakes where few of them survive.But they can now make a more humane choice. Offering a solution to hapless parents who are unable to bring up their newborns, the women and child development (WCD) ministry will now keep cradles at government hospitals, orphanages and police stations across the country where one can leave their child behind for adoption. The cradle will be accompanied by a bell, which a person can ring to notify authorities at the premises after dropping off a baby.\"It is a simple, humane and anonymous method for parents who are unable to look after their child and have to unwillingly part ways with them,\" WCD minister Maneka Gandhi told Mail Today. \"By leaving their child behind in a cradle, parents will knowingly put their child up for adoption.\"TO FILL THE GAPThe move came after the ministry found it difficult to bridge the gap between 600 kids up for adoption and 14,000 requests. The department\\'s statutory body, Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), functions as the nodal agency for adoption of Indian children and is mandated to monitor and regulate adoptions in India as well as abroad.The government\\'s decision also comes as a blessing for childless people and couples. \"This will prove to be a safe place for orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children,\" said a senior ministry official.After a hospital or orphanage is notified by the ringing bell, officials will take the child into custody and he or she will handed over to the area\\'s child welfare committee. The panel will further screen the child and decide if the baby is fit for adoption.REASONS FOR ABANDONMENTThe reasons for abandonment vary: an unwed mother facing social stigma; parents unable to look after their child, often because it is mentally or physically ill; or simply not wanting a girl. The \"surrendered children\" fail to get registered under the adoption list and in the process bring down the number of children ideal for the purpose.The official added the ministry will prioritise adoption demands by single mothers as well as economically welloff mothers and women who are over child- bearing age. While critics argue it could create more problems than it solves, such as increase abandonment, other analysts maintain that forcing parents to keep unwanted children can lead to abuse and infanticide.The WCD ministry has identified private and government hospitals and orphanages as prime locations to place the cradles. Ministry officials are yet to place police stations in the same ambit, citing complications of taking care of infants at such spots and are awaiting the approval of ministry of home affairs for this.WCD ministry officials pointed out that the cradles will help eliminate the guilt and social pressure stifling parents. It will also aid the government in ensuring that a child goes to a family with a good house.Gandhi was inspired during her trip to a child care institution in Guwahati where she saw infants put up for adoption. On asking, she was told that the institution had left a cradle outside its gate where parents parted ways with their children with', '\\n\\n3.59pm GMT\\n15:59\\n\\n\\n\\n2.14pm GMT\\n14:14\\n\\n\\n\\n1.51pm GMT\\n13:51\\n\\nPeep peep!

He is cooking at a prominent restaurant. The minor has turned 23 years old now.?He was always worried about getting lynched and that is why he was sent to the southern part of the country. Now, the verdict has come, focus will again move to him but he is at a place where he might not even see the national news channels. His employer is not aware of his past and even he has left it behind,? said a NGO official, who was part of his rehabilitation process. The officer, however, refused to reveal any further details fearing safety of the ?juvenile?. A year after he walked free, he was employed at a dhaba in south India. ?After his release on December 20, 2015, he was kept with an NGO for a few days. Later, the NGO rehabilitated him to the southern part of the country. He is currently employed as cook at a restaurant,? he said. The officer said that not many are aware of his background. He was 11 when he fled home, 240 km from Delhi. His elder sister single-handedly fends for the family of six ? ailing mother, younger siblings and bedridden father. The family still lives in the same village.After leaving home, he came to Delhi to earn money and got in touch with Ram Singh and the other accused. He used to clean the bus in which the physiotherapist student was raped on December 16, and they would give him food in return. On that night too, they asked him to accompany them.During his time at the shelter, he used to call his mother often, said an official.A number of welfare officers and a counsellor, who spoke to him at the correction home, told HT that he was the most disciplined inmate.They say soon after coming to the shelter, he turned religious. He grew a beard and started offering namaz five times a day. Initially, he was kept away from the other inmates. But during the last year of his stay, he shared the dormitory with a high court blast accused.?This led many to believe that he was radicalised. So he was shifted to a separate room. He had little interest in studies and the only thing he learnt was to write his name. Cooking is his passion and he was always there to give a final touch to dishes prepared by the staff. Inmates often demanded food cooked by him,? the officer added.However, intelligence bureau still keeps a watch on him.?He was a victim of circumstances. When I got a chance to meet him, I found him sad the way his role was portrayed in the incident. He was pushed into child labour at the age of 9 and worked at hazardous sectors.

These led to the rejection of votes by 21 MPs and 56 MLAs, triggering much curiosity and concern among parties.These 77 votes, with a value of 20,942, might be inconsequential to the outcome: NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind romped home with a margin of 3.67 lakh (in terms of value of votes). But there is no full stop in politics, as then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi said after the UPA?s victory in 2009.Both the NDA and the opposition camps are anxious to know how many of the 77 invalid votes were a result of inadvertent errors and how many were by design. Over a hundred legislators were estimated to have cross-voted in valid votes.Those involved in the counting of votes on July 20 told HT that invalid ones were due to dots, inverted commas, circles and slants that electors erroneously used on their ballot papers. They were supposed to express their first preference simply with a numeral 1 ? second preference was unnecessary in a bipolar contest?in the box against the name of Kovind or Meira Kumar, the opposition parties? nominee.A Congress MLA from Haryana wrote 1. (numeral with a period-mark) rendering his vote invalid. Most of the 77 legislators made the same mistake, said those involved in counting.The second most common error was ?1?. Some put a circle around the numeric. The BJP got one vote invalidated because the 1 was slanted ?by about 30 to 40 degrees? and not perpendicular; the Congress got the same opportunity later. One of the MLAs wrote 1 over Meira Kumar?s name.Given that legislators were clearly informed about the dos and don?ts, such errors were unexpected. Many of them could be inadvertent and a result of sheer habit but the rules set by the poll watchdog were not to be bent.Senior BJD leader Bhartruhari Mahtab recalled one such instance in 2012 presidential poll in which he was the counting agent for PA Sangma. A Congress MLA from Odisha decided to go by his conscience?permitted in presidential polls where there is no party whip ? and voted for Sangma. He used Oriya numeral P and not E for 1. Although both are used for 1, his vote was rejected after the Congress objected to it.The list of possible errors is long. According to Anoop Mishra, secretary general of the Lok Sabha and the Returning Officer for the presidential poll, any of these can lead a vote invalid: Writing the same preference number outside both candidate?s names, putting a tick mark, or writing outside the box. ?Votes can also be declared invalid if there are any other marks, which are not required and which can later identify the voter. These can even be a dot, a line or even a wrong-coloured ink,? he told HT.Deepender Singh Hooda, counting agent for Meira Kumar, maintained that ?broadly, votes for both sides got cancelled? due to errors, but the BJP seemed better prepared. Senior BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav, counting agent for Kovind, said that a day before the poling, his party had made a presentation to its legislators on voting rules.?It?s possible that some members themselves might have got their votes rejected, but there could also be inadvertent errors. The Election Commission should think of a better way to ensure that votes are not rejected,? said Hooda.', 'The trouble for Jolly LLB 2 does not seem to end.

Previous disability certificates issued by private doctors are invalid now.A large number of parents are approaching RML doctors. The psychiatry department at the central government hospital is flooded with demands for disability certificates for students.MISUSEIn several case, experts diagnosed students with disability certificates with no disability. \"It is strange to find that even though the child is ineligible to get a disability certificate, top private practitioners\\' at leading hospitals have issued the same to him. It is a complete misuse,\" said a senior psychiatrist at RML requesting anonymity.Dr Smita Desphande, who heads the department of Psychiatry at RML Hospital told Mail Today, \"Our department has been getting at least 10 cases each day, wherein parents ask for disability certificate for their child to get admission done under the disability quota. Parents thus want their children to be categorised under any sort of disability- be it autism, intellectual disability or speech disorder.\"Parents mostly come with their kids complaining Specific Learning Disability (SLD). If doctors approve, the child gets an extra hour for writing and preparing for CBSE, entrance and university exams. Mostly, requests come for students of private schools and colleges.ANYTHING FOR MARKS\"Parents know disability certificates would fetch their kids marks, even if the spelling is wrong, and would allot them extra time during exams. Often they come to us saying, \\'My child does not want to take up Science, so make the certificate according to requirements,\" said a doctor.\"We have a specific tool to calculate the percentage of disability in a child. And when the assessment tool fails to identify any disability, parents force us to still issue a certificate. We were surprised to see that two leading private hospitals in Delhi have made forged disability certificates - which is unethical,\" said a senior psychiatrist at RML. Teachers, according to experts and doctors, are unaware of disability norms.RML doctors said parents are misguided by school teachers often.\"There is very poor awareness in teachers. We get the reference from school teachers who ask us to get the certificate done for so and so and our department has been receiving an increasing number of referral case. There is a need for special educators in schools.\"If a child is found to be not falling under the disabled category completely and is rather differently abled, with 5-10 per cent of disabilty, we provide that particular certificate and also often try to help them improve by intervention or speech therapy. We try to provide them whatever, treatment is required,\" said Dr Desphande.Last month, Mail Today had reported that that the Centre is bringing in 14 new categories of physical and mental conditions, under the ambit of the Disability Act, 2006. At present, the act provides the disability rights and benefits to seven special categories of people comprising blindness, low-vision, locomotive disability, hearing impairment, mental retardation, mental illness and leprosy.The new conditions will apply to people with cerebral palsy, dwarfism, muscular dystrophy, specific learning disabilities, deafness, autism, spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\\'s disease, haemophilia, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, multiple disabilities (condition of any two disabilities or more) and acidattack survivors.Ministry officials said the previous Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 1995, mentions only seven categories including people having 40 per cent and above disability, providing them all benefits.In 2001, disability assessment guidelines were prepared for these categories, but there was no measure to calculate the percentage of disability in a person. \"The ministry therefore formed a committee to review how to assess and measure the exiting as well as the proposed disability percentage in a person and accordingly entitlements would be given to the person,\" an official said.

The 360-foot tall flag is high enough to be spotted from Lahore in Pakistan. Hoisted on a 110-meter high mast, the flag is 120-foot long and 80-foot wide. The weight of the flag pole is 55 tonnes, and an estimated Rs 3.50 crore rupees have been spent on this project by the Punjab government.Before this, the title of the tallest national flag in India belonged to a 293-foot-high tricolour that was hoisted in Jharkhand\\'s Ranchi. PAKISTAN OBJECTSInterestingly, Pakistan is not happy with India\\'s decision to hoist the tricolour at the international border. Sources said the Pakistan Rangers had also conveyed their resentment to the Border Security Force (BSF) and had asked them to install the flag away from the border.Pakistan on Thursday had again raised an objection to the flag being flown at the IB, calling the act a violation of international treaties. Pakistan authorities apparently fear that India could use the mast to spy in Pakistani land by installing cameras on the flag pole.INDIA: NOT VIOLATING ANY TREATYHowever, Indian authorities had made it clear that the flat was being installed 200 metres before the zero line and was not a violation in any manner.\"Not to my knowledge.

The police station now has a two-room ?Phulwari? complete with toys, puzzles and a nanny to ensure children do not get affected by their murky surroundings. ?Kids often accompany adults to the police station and find the surroundings traumatizing,? said ACP Dharna Yadav. ?A number of times, children themselves are the victims and in a traditional police station, they find it difficult to tell us what happened. The play area is meant to provide a friendly environment, which engages them and lets them relax,? she added. Phulwari, which will also double as a crÃ¨che for children of police personnel, has been provided a separate entry separating it from the main police station section. The rooms, which were once the office of a senior official, have been painted with colourful motifs and stocked with story books, art and craft material, puzzles and toys to engage children between 3 to 12 years of age. ?The colours are crucial as they help children express their deepest thoughts, pain and sadness,?

Â\\xa0 The former Bihar governor, who was born in Kanpur, will take the oath of office on July 25 and move to Rashtrapati Bhavan. Outgoing President Pranab Mukherjee will leave for his new residence at 10, Rajaji Marg.When Ram Nath Kovind enters Rashtrapati Bhavan, he will step into a building that was transformed from an imperial mansion into an institution of democracy on January 26, 1950. When Dr Rajendra Prasad occupied the building as country\\'s first President, the Viceroy\\'s House was renamed as Rashtrapati Bhavan. THE MAKING OF RASHTRAPATI BHAVANThe initial amount sanctioned for the construction of Rashtrapati Bhavan was 400,000 pounds. It took 17 years to finish building the Rashtrapati Bhavan in 1929 and by then the construction cost had escalated to 877,136 pounds (In 1929, this was Rs 1.28 crore approx).Add to that the cost of constructing Mughal Garden and the staff quarters, the total cost of building the entire Rashtrapati Bhavan complex stood at Rs 1.4 crore approx.The Rashtrapati Bhavan has a total of 340 rooms spread on four floors. The mansion has a floor area of 200,000 square feet and was built with 700 million bricks and three million cubic feet of stone. The Rashtrapati Bhavan was built using almost no steel. THE INDO-EUROPEAN ARCHITECTUREEdwin Lutyens acknowledged the influence of Roman architecture in Rashtrapati Bhavan. Yet, the building also reflects various motifs from Indian architecture, such as chhatris and jaalis. Temple bells have been used in the pillars of Rashtrapati Bhavan, an idea that came from a Jain temple in Moodabidri in Karnataka. THE MUGHAL GARDENThe Mughal Garden boasts of 250 varieties of roses, making it one of the best rose gardens in the world. Ram Nath Kovind will organise \\'At Homes\\' on Republic Day and Independence Day every year in the Central Lawn.The lawns in the main garden are covered with \\'Doob\\' grass which was originally brought from Belvedere Estate in Kolkata. Peacocks are a regular sight at the Mughal Garden, while once in a while a cormorant can also be spotted. PRESIDENT\\'s BODYGUARDThe President\\'s Bodyguard was raised in 1773 by then Governor Warren Hastings in Benares. The regiment was formed as a select cavalry unit with the role to \"act as bodyguard to the governor in peace and to accompany him as Commander-in-Chief in battle\". The President\\'s Bodyguard excel in ceremonial procedures, are trained as combat paratroopers and armoured vehicle crewmen.THE PRESIDENTIAL RETREATSThe President of India has two retreats in the country--one in Mashobra, Shimla and the other in Bolarum, Hyderabad. Ram Nath Kovind, who was denied entry to the Retreat Building in Shimla two months ago, is set to be the custodian of the presidential retreat. The presidential retreat in Shimla is an entirely wooden structure and is located on the hill top of Mashobra. The presidential retreat in Hyderabad, called the Rashtrapati Nilayam, is an 1860-built building with 11 rooms. The building was taken over from the Nizam of Hyderabad after Independence and handed over to President\\'s secretariat. The President stays at both the retreats at least once in a year.

Well, Shahid himself thought he was a superstar but unfortunately, the editor of a popular film magazine had to disagree.According to Rajeev Masand's latest column in Open Magazine, it all began when Shahid Kapoor did a photoshoot for the cover of a 'popular film glossy' a few days before the release of his film Rangoon. The issue was supposed to hit the stands a couple of weeks after the film's release.When the magazine's team sent Shahid a scan of the feature story, before the issue was sent to the press for printing, Shahid apparently 'balked', according to the magazine's editor. Shahid, reportedly, did not like being called a 'star' in the story's headline and demanded that 'star' should be changed to 'superstar'. Shahid said that if the magazine team did not want to make the change, he wanted the entire story 'pulled'.Consequently, the magazine team made the required change and the edition was sent to the press for printing.But Rangoon finally released and flopped big time. The magazine's editor reportedly 'felt silly for indulging the actor's whims' and immediately ensured that the issue was called back in time so that the headline could be changed again.

These have become defunct after the government recalled the two high-value notes and temple authorities missed last year?s December 30 deadline to get them exchanged.VV Ramanmurthy, a journalist, said in his petition that non-acceptance of the devotees? offering to the temple was not only discriminatory but also meant their wishes will remain unfulfilled.?That the pilgrims and devotees offerings made to Lord Venkateshwara Swami was not accepted/redeemed by Reserve Bank of India, due to which about Rs 8.29 crore consisting of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were packed and kept in boxes with Tirumala Tirupati Devastanam,? read the petition that advocate Shravan Kumar filed on his behalf.The Tirupati board runs a string of temples in cities and towns such as New Delhi, Rishikesh, Guwahati, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kanyakumari.The petitioner said collections at temples in Chennai and Hyderabad are deposited in banks once a week, but it is done once in six months in the other places.Ramanmurthy contended that not accepting public money for charity and services infringes the devotees? fundamental right to practice their religion.He said the board will be unable to utilise the money for its services. Besides, possession of demonetised money is a criminal offence.The petition follows the Supreme Court?s directive on July 4 to the government and RBI to come up with a policy to offer a window to people who could not deposit their old notes for legitimate reasons before the December deadline.Another petition with a similar plea was filed by siblings Arushi and Apurv Jain after they found Rs 60 lakh in old notes in lockers of their parents, who died in a road accident nine years ago. They appealed for a window to exchange the money.The two were given access to the locker this March after they became adults.

', ' In a move to stem farmers? protests against land acquisition for the ambitious Mumbai-Nagpur super communication highway, the state government seems to have opened its purse strings. This week, the Thane district collectorate finalised land rates for farm land in Shahapur taluka, which is the highest compensation paid to farmers in Maharashtra for a  public project,so far. Farmers from Khardi village in Shahapur taluka stand to get Rs 2.43 crore for an acre of land under this project.  The ready reckoner rate for this village for every hectare of land is around Rs29.59 lakh ( Around 2.4 acres make one hectare of land).The compensation for the 23 villages in this taluka, which will lose land to the 706-km highway, ranges from Rs52.16 lakh to Rs5.84 crore for an hectare for land. This works out to Rs21.66 lakh to Rs2.43 crore for an acre of land.  A copy of the land rates announced for every village per hectare is with HT. After Khardi, farmers from villages like Dalkhan, Birwadi and Kasara will get a generous compensation of around Rs74.84 lakh and Rs68.93 lakh for an acre of land. This is a one-time compensation that will be paid to farmers if they opt for direct settlement with the state government. Read:?Congress and Shiv Sena up the ante against Maharashtra government for blanket loan waiverGiven the wide range, however, not all farmers will be happy with the rates announced. So far, the compensation given to farmers for the Shendre-Bidkin industrial park near Aurangabad under the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor for nearly Rs23 lakh an acre was being considered as one of highest payouts for farm land. (In the case of DMIC, however, separate compensation was also given for orchards).Thane district collector Dr Mahendra Kalyankar confirmed the final land rates for farm land in Shahapur taluka.?We are trying to offer the highest land rate possible for every district affected by the project. It?s history in making,?? said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.The compensation for non-agriculture land in Shahapur taluka is even higher, in some cases as high as Rs12.60 crore to Rs18.11 crore for an acre of such land in Khardi and Kasara villages. However, only 10 to 15% of non-agricultural land comes under the highway, with officials claiming these rates could get revised as they seemed exorbitant. The proposed eight-lane highway, which will run across 10 districts to link Nagpur to Thane, is facing stiff opposition from farmers over land acquisition. In a bid to tone down these protests, the government is offering competitive land rates to woo the farmers. The land rates are being worked out by committees appointed for every district led by the collector that considers a variety of parameters including ready reckoner rate of every village, average of last three years of sale deeds, the number of land transactions, compensation as per Land Acquisition law etc, 25 per cent more incentive offered by the state for direct sale.Read: Maharashtra farmer complains against IMD for ?wrong? rain forecastLast week, Nasik district collector had announced land rates for the district in the range of Rs40 lakh to Rs80 lakh for one hectare of land. But this had only intensified protests against the project with farmers from Nasik, not wooed by the compensation offered for their irrigated lands.?We have considered a variety of factors and the rates get jacked up also by the number of land transactions that have taken place in that village. In Khardi, for instance, in the recent past, we noted nearly 500 land sale deeds. This was comparatively far less in Chande village that has among the lowest compensations in Shahapur,?? said a Thane district collectorate official.The Thane collectorate has also worked out rates for Kalyan taluka, which are far lower than Shahapur, with the highest compensation being Rs1.50 crore for an hectare of land or Rs62 lakh for an acre of land. The lowest compensation here is around Rs61.14 lakh for an hectare of land or Rs25.47 lakh for an acre of land.The district administration may revise the land rates for Kalyan taluka given that farmers are likely to react negatively given the high rates offered  in neighbouring Shahapur taluka.', 'China will downsize its 2.3 million-strong military, the world?s largest, to under one million in the biggest troop reduction in its history as part of a restructuring process, an official Chinese daily said.The People?s Liberation Army (PLA) will increase the numbers of other services, including navy and missile forces, the PLA Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese military, reported.Jun Zhengping Studio, a Chinese social WeChat account run by the newspaper published an article yesterday on structural reform in the military, saying that ?the old military structure, where the army accounts for the vast majority, will be replaced after the reform?.?The reform is based on China?s strategic goals and security requirements. In the past, the PLA focused on ground battle and homeland defence, which will undergo fundamental changes,? the report said.?This is the first time that active PLA army personnel would be reduced to below one million,? it said.It added that the number of troops in the PLA Navy, PLA Strategic Support Force and the PLA Rocket Force will be increased, while the PLA Air Force?s active service personnel will remain the same.According to the Ministry of Defence data, the PLA Army had about 8.50 lakh combat troops in 2013. No official numbers of the total strength of PLA Army were released.Earlier, Chinese President Xi Jinping had announced that the PLA will be cut by three lakh troops.?The total PLA personnel was about 2.3 million before the country announced a cut of 300,000 troops in 2015,? state-run Global Times reported.?This reform will provide other services, including the PLA Rocket Force, Air Force, Navy and Strategic Support Force (mainly responsible for electronic warfare and communication), with more resources and inputs, and the PLA will strengthen its capability to conduct overseas missions,? Xu Guangyu, a senior adviser to the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, was quoted by the media report.The PLA Daily article said that China?s overseas interests were spread around the world and needed to be protected.?These are beyond the army?s current capabilities,? Xu said.The PLA structure should also fit China?s international status, Xu said.', 'There is only a 5% chance that the Earth will avoid warming by at least 2C come the end of the century, according to new research that paints a sobering picture of the international effort to stem dangerous climate change.Global trends in the economy, emissions and population growth make it extremely unlikely that the planet will remain below the 2C threshold set out in the Paris climate agreement in 2015, the study states. The Paris accord, signed by 195 countries, commits to holding the average global temperature to ?well below 2C? above pre-industrial levels and sets a more aspirational goal to limit warming to 1.5C. This latter target is barely plausible, the new research finds, with just a 1% chance that temperatures will rise by less than 1.5C. ?We?re closer to the margin than we think,? said Adrian Raftery, a University of Washington academic who led the research, published in Nature Climate Change. ?If we want to avoid 2C, we have very little time left. The public should be very concerned.? Governments settled on the 2C threshold partly through political expediency but also because scientists have warned of severe consequences from sea level rise, drought, heatwaves and social unrest should the temperature rise beyond this.  Such risks have been underscored by a separate study, also released on Monday, that shows unabated climate change will cause around 60,000 deaths globally in 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100. The study, by the University of North Carolina, found that rising temperatures will exacerbate air pollutants that will particularly threaten those with existing conditions.  According to the University of Washington study, there is a 90% likelihood that temperatures will rise between 2C and 4.9C by 2100. This would put the world in the mid-range warming scenarios mapped out by the UN?s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It negates the most optimistic outcome as well as the worst case, which would see temperatures climb nearly 6C beyond the pre-industrial era. Rather than look at how greenhouse gases will influence temperature, the new research analyzed the past 50 years of trends in world population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for each dollar of economic activity. After building a statistical model covering a range of emissions scenarios, the researchers found that carbon intensity will be a crucial factor in future warming. Technological advances are expected to cut global carbon intensity by 90% over the course of the century, with sharp declines in China and India ? two newly voracious consumers of energy. However, this decline still will not be steep enough to avoid breaching the 2C limit.  The world?s population is expected to grow to about 11 billion people by 2100, but the research found that this will have a relatively small impact upon temperatures as much of this growth will take place in sub-Saharan Africa, which is a minor contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. It has long been acknowledged that emissions cuts promised under the the Paris agreement would not be sufficient to avoid 2C warming. However, it is hoped that periodic reviews of commitments will result in more severe reductions. Donald Trump?s pledge to remove the US, the world?s second-largest emitter, from the accord has cast a large shadow over these ambitions.  ?Even if the 2C target isn?t met, action is very important,? said Raftery. ?The more the temperature increases, the worse the impacts will be. ?We would warn against any tendency to use our results to say that we won?t avoid 2C, and so it?s too late to do anything. On the contrary, avoiding the higher temperature increases that our model envisages is even more important, and also requires urgent action.? Raftery acknowledged that a breakthrough technology could ?dramatically? change the outlook but noted that major advances of the past 50 years, such as the computer, robotics, hybrid cars, the internet and electronic fuel injection, have improved carbon efficiency steadily at around 2% a year, rather than in huge jumps. Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University who was not involved in the study, said the research?s conclusions were ?reasonable? but said it was difficult to assign a precise probability to future temperature rises. ?I agree that staying below 2C and 1.5C are unlikely and very, very unlikely, respectively,? he said. ?But this research gives a false sense of rigor. Tomorrow someone could invent a carbon-free energy source that everyone adopts. ?If you look at technology adoption and action taken on the ozone layer and acid rain, it?s clear these things can change faster than people predict.? Dessler said the falling cost of renewable energy would be a major factor in reducing emissions but further impetus would be needed through new actions such as a price on carbon.  ?It?s like you?re driving and about to collide with the car in front of you,? he said. ?You want to hit the brakes as fast as you can. The later you wait, the more painful it?s going to be.?John Sterman, an academic at the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, said the research was an ?urgent call to action?. MIT research has shown that emissions cuts in the Paris agreement would stave off around 1C of temperature increase by 2100 ? findings misrepresented by Trump when he announced the US departure from the pact.Sterman said the US must ?dramatically speed the deployment of renewable energy and especially energy efficiency. Fortunately, renewables, storage and other technologies are already cheaper than fossil energy in many places and costs are falling fast.?More aggressive policies are urgently needed, but this study should not be taken as evidence that nothing can be done.?', 'Inzamam-ul-Haq, chief selector of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), believes the clash against their arch-rivals India in next month\\'s Champions Trophy will be important for the Men in Green to make a right start in the tournament.India announced its 15-member squad for the upcoming 50-over pinnacle tournament on Monday, and the fans from both nations have marked their calendars for June 4 when the two arch-rivals take on each other in their group clash.Inzamam admitted that Pakistan didn\\'t have a good record against India in the major events, but added he was sure his players could perform well this time around.\"We don\\'t have a great record against India in major events, but every day is a new day and I am sure the players will perform well in the first match.

The state education department said it will hold a meeting with elected representatives and stakeholders to consider admitting students in colleges near their homes and request the Bombay high court to amend the existing rules.Legislators said since online admissions were based on the marks student secure, students from Colaba and Fort are made to travel as far as Borivli or Ghatkopar and students in Ghatkopar get admission in Goregaon colleges. Colaba?s BJP MLA Raj Purohit said it was unfair for students living in south Mumbai, which has the most colleges, as they are forced to travel to suburban colleges because of their marks. Congress?

The procedure we follow has been approved by the Bombay high court. We are positive about changing the norms to allow students to bag seats in colleges near them,? he said. BJP?s Sunil Deshmukh, however, opposed the demand and said admissions should be granted based on merit and that would be unjust for high-scorers as they could be denied admission to good colleges. While updating legislators about this year?s junior college admissions, Tawde said, ?About 2.68 lakh students in Mumbai have sought admissions in FYJC and the government has made arrangements for 15,000 more seats. The students faced difficulties after the website crashed. About 10,000 students changed their minds after filing the forms and figuring in the first list. This too inconvenienced other students.?

The minister told the Assembly that the government had taken note of such activities taking place in some schools, particularly in parts of north Bengal and North 24-Parganas district in south Bengal. Chatterjee said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in her capacity as the Home minister, had also given him a list of some schools allegedly indulging in such activities and after due process the \"no objection certificate\" (NOC) of some of these institutions were cancelled. Warning that the government would not allow any attempt to promote religious intolerance through teachings in some private schools, the minister said that educational institutions would have to adhere to the syllabus of the board to which these are affiliated. Chatterjee points out that many of these private schools get affiliation from different central boards of education and then take an NOC from the state, making it difficult for the state to directly act against them.

The department has issued the show cause notice to the partys convenor - Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal- and three others and has sought the partys reply in this regard by first half of this month. The tax department has charged the party with not filing a \"true and correct\" contribution report for donations received for the assessment year 2014-15 which have been found to be over Rs 30.08 crore after year long investigations. The taxman said the first audit report filed by the party to it and the Election Commission, under the provisions of the Representation of People Act, were \"incorrect and fabricated\". The notice said that in view of these charges, the department seeks to file a prosecution complaint (charge sheet) under I-T laws in a court under sections 277A (false statement in verification) and 276C (wilful attempt to evade tax). A maximum of three years rigorous imprisonment and a fine can be levied on an accused once the charges are proved in court. It said that the exemption enjoyed by the Kejriwal-led AAP from paying income tax on donations could also be withdrawn as these privileges have been \"wrongly claimed\". Political parties enjoy tax exemption under section 13A of the Income Tax Act. The notice while acknowledging that the party had accepted that there were \"certain errors\" in its first report filed in this regard, added that this admission by the AAP was itself an evidence that its audit report was fabricated initially but was corrected after the taxman began investigations of its audit books and accounts.

The Congress leader said that Nitish Kumar was given the mandate for his fight against anti-communal forces but now he has joined hands with the same forces.

The pattern is such that the conspirators and the men who defend the accused are the same. There is evidence that sangh parivar members were involved in the murder of a panchayat vice-president. Provocative speeches made by Bhat often lead to communal violence in the region. I only asked the SP to book cases against the instigators,\" added Rai.

Clinton told Obama, who had contacted her to extend his condolences for her loss.The phone call is one of several revelations in the new book Shattered, in which the journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes chronicle Clinton?s 18-month quest to do what eluded her in 2008 and break ?that highest, hardest glass ceiling?.The book sheds particular light on the painful turn of events on election night, as Clinton watched the returns deviate dramatically from the path her campaign had so confidently predicted. Surrounded by family and aides at the Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan, she saw the first cracks emerge as the must-win state of Florida turned dicey. Steve Schale, among the most reliable Democratic strategists in the state, informed Clinton?s campaign they were short on votes.As other battlegrounds began to crumble, a sober mood took hold in the suite. But soon, the authors wrote, aides began to blame each other as Bill Clinton grew increasingly upset and Hillary Clinton became withdrawn.It was Obama, taking in the results with his own advisers in Washington, who broke up the slumber with a series of phone calls from the White House. Wisconsin, a Democratic stronghold, had just been called for Trump. Some states remained excruciatingly close, but the president was convinced of the outcome and did not want to question the legitimacy of the election as Trump had done just weeks earlier while facing off against Clinton in the debates.?You need to concede,? Obama told Clinton after his political director had failed to persuade Clinton?s campaign manager, Robby Mook, on the point.It took one more phone call from the president ? to Clinton?s campaign chairman, John Podesta ? before she asked her close aide Huma Abedin for the phone and uttered the words she never thought she would say: ?Congratulations, Donald. ?I?ll be supportive of the country?s success, and that means your success as president,? Clinton said.It was after her brief conversation with Trump that Clinton apologized to Obama.The book is the second collaboration for Allen and Parnes, who in 2014 authored HRC, a detailed account of Clinton?s tenure at the helm of the state department, in anticipation of her second presidential run. As the first take on Clinton?s doomed campaign, they offer a behind-the-scenes view of the obstacles in her way ? some familiar and others a consequence of the shifting American electorate. There is the familiar tension between the old guard that has for decades operated ?Clintonworld? and the new blood that labored in Brooklyn to reinvent the campaign of one of the most well-known public figures in the world. The authors revisit the unexpected challenge from Bernie Sanders, whose insurgent campaign captured the wave of economic populism sweeping the country. The infighting amid the Democratic primaries, as Team Clinton struggled to decisively put away the senator, is a dominant theme of the book?s first half.And then there are the emails.The aftermath of Clinton?s decision to use a private email server as secretary of state, and subsequent discord among her inner circle over how to respond, is retold with the benefit of hindsight. We learn that Bill Clinton did not believe she should apologize, as neither he nor she felt there had been any wrongdoing.Clinton eventually did apologize to the public in August 2015, six months after the server issue was first brought to light.The role of Russian interference in the US election, now the subject of three investigations in Washington, is barely explored in the book, although the authors do say that Clinton?s former aides see it as one of the main reasons for her loss.The effects of Trump?s nationalist campaign are also relegated to the backseat, as this is a story primarily told through how Clinton?s campaign adapted (or sometimes crucially didn?t) to the evolving political climate. Staffers were confident in their sophisticated voter modeling and analytics, and fatally failed to spot when they veered off target.Clinton, for her part, carried a lingering doubt throughout the campaign. ?Why aren?t they with me?? she asked of working class white people during the Democratic primaries. ?Why can?t we bring them onboard??It was a question her campaign never quite answered.', 'Priyadarshan, the chairperson of the feature film section for the National Film Awards, said he does not understand why people are questioning Akshay Kumar\\'s Best Actor award. The filmmaker has collaborated with Akshay Kumar in films like Hera Pheri, Garam Masala, Bhagam Bhaag, Bhool Bhulaiya, De Dana Dan and Khatta Meetha. Many in social media are attributing Akshay\\'s win to his close proximity to Priyadarshan. But the director says last year Ramesh Sippy was head of the jury and none questioned his good friend Amitabh Bachchan\\'s Best Actor win, so why should he and Akshay be subjected to such allegations. \"I have heard of all that and I will answer it in a simple way. When Ramesh Sippy was jury head Amitabh Bachchan won. When Prakash Jha was head of jury, Ajay Devgan won. None questioned at that time. So why all these questions are cropping up today,\" Priyadarshan told PTI. The filmmaker also clarified that Akshay\\'s performance in Rustom and Airlift were considered by the jury during the selection process. However, as only the name of one film could be mentioned, the list featured the courtroom drama Rustom, he said. \"Akshay was given the best actor on the basis of his performance in two films -- Airlift and Rustom. It was the jury\\'s decision. One performance was dramatic and one was realistic. But according to the rule book, only one film can be mentioned and Rustom was mentioned in the list. But the award recognises his performance in both the movies,\"said Priyadarshan.This year saw the dominance of regional cinema at the National Film Awards with Marathi film Kasaav winning best feature film, Surabhi CM getting best actress and Rajesh Mapuskar being named best director for Marathi movie Ventilator. Bollywood films which managed to score are Pink (Best Film on Social Issues), Dhanak (Best Children\\'s Film) and Neerja (Best Hindi Film). Priyadarshan says regional films don\\'t chase after box office numbers and that is why they are true to their stories and also give social messages. \"While watching films we realised that a lot of Bollywood movies were themed around homosexuality. The movies are not really highlighting social problems. Whereas regional cinema are themed around fantastic social issues. They try to tell different stories. Even Dangal doesn\\'t talk about social issues. It was a life story,\" said Priyadarshan. \"Regional movies are not made with the aim to earn Rs 100 crore. They are made from the heart. We should promote films that reflect the Indian culture.

These libraries are unique in their own way as they have been put together from the citizen local area development fund, or Swaraj fund, and were taken up after people chose them as priority projects in mohalla sabhas conducted in various assembly constituencies last year. Though the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has started working on projects promised during the Mohalla Sabhas, the fate of Swaraj fund for the current fiscal (2016-17) itself hangs in balance.Officials say that the constitution of mohalla sabhas and creating a project management unit under it are yet to get approval from the Lieutenant Governor. The fate of Rs 350 crore, allocated under Swaraj fund in the annual budget, hence, by the AAP government remains unclear. With only three months left in the current fiscal, officials said they were not sure if funds will be utilised at all this year.?The process of holding mohalla sabhas across the city and then implementing the projects chosen as priority is a long-drawn one. Eight public libraries, construction of which were decided in mohalla sabhas in Karawal Nagar assembly constituency on a pilot basis last fiscal (2015-16), will be inaugurated on Sunday. Any delay in approval could lead to lapse of funds this year,? said a senior revenue department official. In June, the Arvind Kejriwal cabinet had cleared a proposal to constitute 2,972 mohalla sabhas, besides creating a project management unit (PMU) called Mission Swaraj to co-ordinate the entire project. Both proposals were then sent to the L-G for his approval. Mohalla sabhas were conducted in 11 assembly segments including Karawal Nagar in May last year. Development works worth R 50 lakh in each of the 11 assembly segment were decided in these meetings. Karwal Nagar MLA and water minister Kapil Mishra said the government had not lost hope on holding such sabhas before the end of this fiscal. ?The initiative is a unique step to ensure citizen participation in governance. It would be for the first time that eight libraries in an assembly segment are coming up, which was actually decided by area residents themselves. Even if the L-G clears the approval now, the government will at least hold these sabhas,? said Mishra.

She had come to the city in search of a job, they added.She was waiting near Safdarjung Tomb for a bus to Noida when a man, identified as Avnish, pulled up in a Maruti Suzuki SX4 car with a home ministry sticker on the windscreen.He posed as a cabbie and offered to drop her home for Rs 20 ? the usual rate for shared cabs from the area to Noida -- officials said.The driver then allegedly drove her around the city -- RK Puram, Chanakyapuri, India Gate and then back to Dhaula Kuan ? and when the woman asked him about the roundabout route, he refused to answer.?She alleged that the driver took her to a secluded spot in Moti Bagh and parked the car on one side.

The crime came to light after the girl?s family brought her to Kalawati Hospital with injuries.The cases are a bitter reminder of the night of December 16, 2012, when the physiotherapy student was brutally gang-raped by six men on a chartered bus that she had boarded after she failed to get an auto or a public bus from south Delhi?s Saket to Dwarka.The crime triggered massive protests across the country as thousands of people demanded stricter laws and police patrolling to improve a shameful record of safety for female citizens in Delhi, where a woman reports a rape every four hours.The protests caused far-reaching changes in India?s rape laws and a nationwide churning that effected sensitisation programmes in police and administration.Similar to the crime four years ago, the 20-year-old woman said she got into the cab as she was getting late and no auto rickshaw had agreed to take her for the past 1.5 hours, police said.The woman said that she fought back against the driver and managed to escape from the car.

He told police he purchased the car a few months ago and appointed Avnish as the driver a week ago.Pawar said the MHA sticker had expired and he had put it on the car?s windshield to avoid paying toll tax.According to sources, three teams were formed to search for the car, which was found abandoned near Moti Bagh, 100 meters away from the spot where the woman was allegedly raped. The police then immediately traced the owner from the car?s registration number to Kotla Mubarakpur.

Excerpts.Q. Cheteshwar, it must feel good to go in with runs under your belt as you approach the five Test matches ahead, one against Bangladesh and four vs Australia.A. Yes. It was a very good practice match for me, the Irani trophy. It was an ideal match to play well and contribute for team\\'s success. My partnership with (Wriddhiman) Saha was crucial. It was a very good platform to prepare for five Tests coming up against Bangladesh and Australia. (Smith wants Warner to score big like Karun Nair)Q. There\\'s one advantage of playing just a format internationally which you do currently. That you can prepare this way for the season unlike a lot of your team mates who are in the middle of an intense limited overs series.A. That\\'s right. When you play a first-class game and score a hundred it gives you a lot of confidence. Your concentration comes back, your rhythm comes back. You start moving your feet which is really important in the longer format of the game in particular. (Saha vs Parthiv Patel: India\\'s wicketkeeping dilemma)Q.

So very happy to play at No.3. As a team also we have played some really good cricket in 2016. We want to maintain that. Q. The other debate at the start of the season was around your strike rate. How much hard work did it take to address that? How much support did you get from the team management?A. Anil bhai has been good. He knows what is the commitment and discipline required at Test level. He and Virat (Kohli) both have been motivating. Anil bhai asked me to keep positive intent. I think if I am positive, the bowler has to try to do something different. That\\'s helped. So I have improved in strike rate. But it\\'s not something I have to worry too much about as long as I am scoring and we are winning.Q. Your thoughts on the next Test against Bangladesh. A team not too foreign to Indian conditions.A. Bangladesh are a good team. They do well in Asia. So we can\\'t take them lightly. But at the same time our bowlers have been bowling very well. Our fast bowlers, our spinners and our lower-middle order contributions. If we continue playing the same way we should be able to beat them.Q. Australia will come next after Bangladesh. Their Test cricket is going through a bit of a slump. India will fancy their chances?A. You can\\'t underestimate Australia. They play well at home and we do have an advantage here.

Perhaps some of you would want to remind them what happened the last time they came to India.A. Yes it will be challenging for Australia in India.

Each of these 300 Whatsapp groups had around 250 members, the official said while explaining how determined attempts were being made to disrupt the operations of the security forces by mobilising stone-pelting mobs at the encounter sites. \"We identified the groups and the group administrators, who were called in by police for counselling. We have had a good response to this initiative,\" he said on the condition of anonymity. In the last three weeks, more than 90 per cent of these Whatsapp groups have been shut down, the official said. He said the governments policy of suspending internet services appeared to be showing positive results in curbing stone-pelting during encounters and cited the case of yesterdays encounter in Budgam district. Just a few youth gathered to hurl stones after two militants were gunned down in the encounter yesterday. This was in sharp contrast to an encounter in Durbugh village in the same area on March 28, when a large number of stone-pelters had assembled and three of them were killed in firing by security forces. \"With no internet services, the mobilisation of mobs has almost become impossible. Earlier, we would see youth from as far as 10 kilometres from the encounter sites joining the protesters to pelt stones at security forces to disrupt the anti-militancy operations. \"That did not happen yesterday during or after the encounter in the absence of internet on mobiles,\" the official said. He said some of the youth listed personal issues like alleged harassment by security forces as reasons for taking to stone-pelting. \"Most of them get carried away momentarily,\" he said, adding authorities are also looking at further sensitising the personnel on the need to adopt a humane approach while dealing with the youth. \"With the internet facility withdrawn, the activity on these social networking groups and other sites like Facebook has come down drastically,\" he added. Stone-pelting on security forces near the encounter sites has been causing major operational problems for the law enforcing agencies over the past one year. More than half a dozen youth have been killed in such incidents in the first quarter of this year.

Teng Hong, a doctor who helped with the delivery, said the mother went through menopause about a decade ago. She was able to conceive after undergoing in vitro fertilisation overseas. Due to her age, the woman faced a lot of health risks during pregnancy, including gestational diabetes and internal bleeding, Teng said. \"But shes very strong. She received treatment with an optimistic attitude and overcame all the difficulties to gave birth,\" Teng said. She said the baby is in good condition. As the woman is no longer able to lactate, the child is being fed baby formula. \"Were keeping a close eye on the mother because women of this age can encounter cardiac failure and uncontrollable bleeding during or after a C-section, which are very dangerous,\" Teng said. In recent years, China has seen several cases of older women having children. Although there is no official data, including who is the oldest, anecdotal evidence suggests most of the older women had another baby after they lost their first child.

He retired to Panchgani, a mountain resort near Poona (now Pune), where he stayed at Dilkhush Bungalow.?A group of 18 or 20 men reached Panchgani by a chartered bus from Poona and held a day-long protest against Gandhi.

Bhilare Guruji had recalled at the event.?All of us had assembled in the Batha High School hall for the evening prayers when suddenly a door opposite me opened and in rushed Nathuram Godse. He was wielding a knife and muttering incoherently.?Bhilare blocked his path and twisted the knife out of his hand.?My colleagues in the Seva Dal were also quick to react, and threw him out of the premises,? he had recalled.Bhilare had also claimed that Gopal Godse and Narayan Apte, who were implicated in the Mahatma?s assassination, were present at the spot.The Panchgani incident has been documented in the memoirs of Gandhiji?s close associate, said Pyarelal, a functionary of Mani Bhawan in Mumbai from where Mahatma Gandhi initiated satyagraha and propagated the cause of swadeshi.

The Koreans earned several penalty corners but failed to convert from any as the Indian defence closed them down perfectly. The best chance of the half fell to Mahima Choudhary. A defensive mistake in the Korean penalty circle saw the ball fall to Sangita who flashed a shot across the goal with Mahima waiting for the opportunity at the far post. But the weight on the pass was too much for Mahima as the chance went wide.India took the lead minutes after the break as Ritu scored the opener off a penalty corner.A few minutes later, some brilliant interplay between Lalremsiami and Sangita saw the latter's shot stopped on the line illegally as India were awarded a penalty stroke. But Manpreet Kaur's attempt to convert the stroke was denied by South Korean goalkeeper Lee Da Bom.\", 'London, Mar 18 (PTI) A five-legged lamb has been born at a farm in the UK and named after a Tom Hanks character. The Texel Mule cross was born on Thursday in Derbyshire and farm owner Mark Bayley said he was totally healthy. The Bayley family nicknamed the young male Forrest in the hope his extra limb gives him the same love of running as film character Forrest Gump.

The extra limb, which sits just behind Forrests left front leg, is slightly shorter than the other four so is not interfering with his mobility at the farm in Ashbourne.

The mask, that dates back to about 1000 BC, was found at a site where adults and children were buried. Holes mark the position of the masks eyes, nose and mouth, with additional small, circular openings near the edges that could have been threaded to secure it to a face or an object. Scientists from University of Buenos Aires in Argentina also found a source of copper ore within 70 kilometres of the location where the mask was uncovered, suggesting that it was produced locally. It is probable that metalworking emerged in Argentina at the same time that it was developing in Peru, the researchers wrote in the study published in the journal Antiquity. The metal mask - along with a collection of human bones ? was found in a tomb near a village in northwestern Argentina. There were about 14 bodies in the burial area, with the bones all mixed together and the mask placed on top of one corner of the pile.

It shows that China fixes the trijunction far south of where India and Bhutan do, which explains the current stand-off.WHAT THE MAP SHOWSThe Chinese trijunction, marked by an arrow that claims it is under the 1890 Britain-China treaty, is at the Mount Gipmochi. This is far south of where India and Bhutan mark the trijunction, which the map acknowledged with a dotted line.The area on the Doklam plateau south of the dotted line is claimed by China, and it is here that Beijing was building a road into what Bhutan sees as its territory, triggering the stand-off with Bhutan and India.The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday: \"The line commences at Mount Gipmochi on the Bhutan frontier, and follows the above-mentioned water-parting to the point where it meets Nepal territory. It is without any doubt that the spot where the Indian border troops trespassed is on the Chinese side of the boundary.\"INDIA CONCERNED OVER CHINESE INCURSION India, however, on Friday reminded China that building a road in this disputed area was a violation. \"India is deeply concerned at the recent Chinese actions and has conveyed to the Chinese Government that such construction would represent a significant change of status quo with serious security implications for India,\" the Ministry of External Affairs said.\"In this context, the Indian side has underlined that the two Governments had in 2012 reached agreement that the tri-junction boundary points between India, China and third countries will be finalized in consultation with the concerned countries. Any attempt, therefore, to unilaterally determine tri-junction points is in violation of this understanding. Where the boundary in the Sikkim sector is concerned, India and China had reached an understanding also in 2012 reconfirming their mutual agreement on the \"basis of the alignment\". Further discussions regarding finalization of the boundary have been taking place under the Special Representatives framework.\" Also Read:India-China standoff in Sikkim: What happened at Doka La', 'Shah Rukh Khan burst onto the Bollywood scene in 1992 with Deewana, and in no time, he had millions of girls swooning over his dimpled smile and wanting to run into his outstretched arms.

A group of women pub workers, fed up with obscene gestures and physical assault by a few men, took out their slippers to teach their tormentors a lesson.The brawl was captured by several onlookers on their mobile phones and these clips are now in circulation on social media. The half-hour high drama makes a mockery of Gurugram Police\\'s claims of night patrol at the stretch, which has been in news for open sex trade and crimes against women.MISSING POLICE PRESENCE\"There was hardly any police presence on MG Road when this incident happened. Onlookers were busy shooting the fight on their cameras,\" BN Lal, an eye-witness and a resident of the area, told Mail Today. \"While sex deals taking place on the (MG) road are an open secret, police patrolling is seen only after a major crime is highlighted in the media. A few weeks later, it is business as usual,\" Lal added. Several eyewitnesses said the \"ugly episode\" took place around 1 AM when a group of four to five women, apparently working with the various pubs in the vicinity, were waiting outside Sahara Mall for transport. \"Some drunk men repeatedly made obscene gestures to the women and one of them approached them. This was followed by heated arguments and commotion, which made the men leave the spot,\" said one of the eyewitnesses, requesting anonymity.\"However, these men, about a dozen in count, returned five-ten minutes later and again approached one of the younger women in the group,\" said the eyewitness. \"They must have been emboldened by the absence of any police patrol vehicle in the area.\"Lal said a fresh round of arguments began after which one of the men tried to pull one of the women to where his vehicle was parked. The scuffle sparked anxiety among other women who rushed to help their colleague.SLIPPERS FLY\"One of them took out his slipper and waved at the assailant. In a flash, all the women took off their footwear and began beating up the harasser. His friends came to help him but they also received the same treatment,\" Lal said. \"As a crowd gathered, the men ran away in their vehicles.\"There are seven night clubs in Sahara Mall and each has the capacity of hosting about 100 guests. Local residents complain that at 1 AM, when these pubs down shutters, MG road gets crowded with groups of drunk men who are a nuisance. \"The situation is worst on weekends,\" said a resident.A security guard at the mall, who refused to be named, said when the patrons come out of these night clubs, they try to strike deals with women, some of whom are regular employees and others who facilitate entry to stag pub-goers. \"Such brawls usually occur when either a deal goes wrong or regular women employees are inappropriately approached. The Saturday incident seems to be the latter case,\" said the guard. \"When Gurgaon Police are around, there is little nuisance but when the patrol party is absent, such arguments are common. Only this time, the molesters were at the receiving end,\" the guard added.There are 15 night clubs in various malls on the stretch. Residents said they have approached the district administration but it has failed to come with an effective strategy to deal with the weekly ruckus. \"Pub owners must be held accountable for such incidents. They must ensure that female guests or staff leave their premises safely,\" said a local resident.City police tried to wash their hands of the matter by saying that such incidents were more of a social problem then a crime.

Radioactive Materials.?Thomas and her family now live just down the road in Nucla, a shrinking rural town still dependent on the mining industry.Nucla became nationally famous when it passed an ordinance requiring every household to own a gun five years ago ? a move that is still wildly popular among residents. But past Nucla?s one minute of fame, locals worry about their beloved home becoming a ghost town.In September, in the wake of a lawsuit from an environmental group, Nucla?s major employer, the local coal-fired power plant, announced that it would be shutting down in 2022. The coal mine that supplied the plant would be shutting down as well. In total, about 80 jobs were at risk ? a huge number in a town whose population boasted, according to the 2010 census, only 711 people. For locals, this decision was a death knell brought on by liberals who live in big cities. Nucla residents bristle at the warnings about the risk of exposure to radiation, and roll their eyes at A-listers like Darryl Hannah, the Hollywood actress known for Splash and Kill Bill, who joined the activism against the local uranium industry. Liberals fighting against the mining industry are good at telling them no, residents say, but don?t present them with any alternatives ? not ones that come with real salaries. Richard Craig, a former Nucla town board member, recalled a comment by a member of an environmental group saying during one of the contentious hearings: ?Well, I don?t see why they don?t want to go live in the city.??It?s almost like ? I hate using this word, it?s being used so often ? it?s almost like a conspiracy: ?We need to move everybody out of rural areas and go live in the cities and suburbs,?? Craig said.Nucla made national headlines in 2013. That year, in the wake of the Sandy Hook mass shooting that left 20 first-graders dead, Colorado passed new gun control laws, banning the sale of new ammunition magazines with more than 15 rounds and requiring that private citizens perform criminal background checks before selling guns to each other. The laws were hailed by gun control advocates nationwide as a sign of progress despite the gun debate stalemate in Washington.Nucla moved in precisely the opposite direction: it passed an ordinance mandating that every head of household had to own a gun. Kennesaw, Georgia, had passed a similar ordinance in 1982. After Craig heard about it, he proposed the idea in a town board meeting. ?It was kind of a joke to start with,? he said, sunk deep into the blue plush chair in his cluttered living room. But the reaction from other town board members was immediately positive. Nucla locals, who had been fighting with liberals for years over uranium and coal, loved the idea. ?They said, ?That sounds cool,?? he says. ?I went, ?Uh-oh.??Craig received congratulatory phone calls from gun rights groups across the country, and the town took the national media attention in stride. Locals still talk fondly of the controversy over the town?s prairie dog shooting contest in 1990, which attracted dozens of animal rights activists and made the pages of People magazine. (During the shoot, the Los Angeles Times reported, picketers chanted ?What are you gonna shoot when the prairie dogs are gone?? and a local woman called out: ?Protesters!?)Craig himself saw the ordinance as responding to yet another irrational liberal attack on rural jobs. After Colorado passed its law on magazine limits, Magpul, a company that manufactures firearms accessories, left the state of Colorado in protest for Wyoming, where it reportedly expanded its workforce and secured a lucrative contract to provide ammunition magazines to the US marine corps. But he was dismissive of Barack Obama?s controversial analysis during his 2008 campaign that small-town residents ?get bitter? and ?cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren?t like them? as a way to channel their frustration. ?The jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing?s replaced them,? Obama had said. ?And each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not.? Craig maintains that Nucla?s love of guns is not rooted in bitterness. Even before the new rule was approved, most people in Nucla were already gun owners. The ordinance itself contains broad exceptions, not only for felons and those with a mental illness, but also for people who cannot afford a gun or simply wish to be ?conscientious objectors?. This makes it more or less unenforceable.Still, Nucla?s commitment to gun ownership is no joke. There?s a tiny pink sign decorated with pistols at the local sheriff?s department ? it reads: ?We don?t call 911.? The town has no bars, no liquor stores, no movie theaters or malls, but it does have its own public gun range, free for use by all. The few local Democrats are no exception, including Craig himself and the local pharmacist, who was a prize-winning competitive shooter in college. Nucla?s historian, Marie Templeton, keeps a beloved gun her husband gave her as an anniversary gift. ?I?m sure that the people who live in cities have no conception of what a gun means to a person in a small town like this. What do you use a gun for? Well, you kill rattlesnakes, for one thing!? she said. She got up from her kitchen table to fetch a stack of photographs of mountain lions and bears that had been spotted in her neighbor?s yard. The ordinance didn?t even faze Shirley Miller, an Englishwoman who moved from Essex to be with her American husband. She said her adjustment was easy for the most part. Coming from a small village to the east of London, Great Wakering, she finds small-town England and small-town America mostly alike, except for Nucla?s blazing, dusty summers and, of course, its bounteous guns.That aside, Nucla?s culture is not so different from small English villages, Miller said: the lack of diversity; the mix of open-mindedness and old prejudice among the residents. There have been small adjustments. She imports her Tesco and Yorkshire tea by mail, along with the occasional package of sultanas and Marmite, and each year she lets a friend?s sheep graze in the empty pasture by her house, adding a nice pastoral touch to the property. She refuses to say a word against the gun ordinance. People who live in cities have no conception of what a gun means in a side town like this?Although I come from a culture where there are no guns, and it?s different here, I don?t see the problem here in Nucla,? she said diplomatically. ?If I were living in the city [these gun laws] would worry me. Here it doesn?t,? she said before adding wryly: ?There is no crossfire here.?Even the town?s emergency medical technician ? the major healthcare provider in the area during the night, when the local clinic is closed ? said he carried a gun, as did the ambulance driver. The EMT, Jeff Stephens, said the ambulance had been held up twice.Last November, officials said, a heavily armed man with a history of anger at law enforcement opened fire on a sheriff?s deputy while he was driving in a remote area not far from Nucla. The officer returned fire, killing the man. A local prosecutor found the officer?s actions justified.But that shooting was an anomaly for the area. ?Prior to that, the last violent shooting was in 1986 or so,? Stephens said, when a man tried to break up a fight between a man and his wife outside a bar in Naturita, the town next door, and was shot to death.Stephens said he does see occasional firearm accidents. There were two in recent memory: one a man shooting himself in the leg, another a young man shooting his partner in the knee. Both shootings involved alcohol, he said.Word travels quickly in a town of a few hundred people. I had given Craig, the architect of the gun ordinance, a call in advance of my trip to Nucla, and shortly after I arrived in town he tried to reach me on my cellphone. I didn?t immediately pick up, so Craig called the front desk of the hotel one town over, and a hotel employee dashed downstairs as I was starting to eat lunch. She handed me a fluorescent post-it note: it had Craig?s name and home number on it.By my third day in town, a woman stopped me outside of Nucla?s one restaurant, the Fifth Avenue Grill, to recommend someone for an interview. Had we met the day before? I wondered, confused. We had not. But she had heard all about me already. Later that day, a stranger in the burger joint one town over, a 1950s-style diner run by Seventh Day Adventists, broke into my note-taking to warn me that I had better be writing a nice story. I pulled up a chair to his family?s table. His son was just hoping the jobs would hang on long enough for his daughter to graduate from high school. Many of the residents were no strangers to the boom-bust cycle of the mining industry. It?s always been boom and bust, they told me, for the past hundred years. Sharon Johannsen, Jane Thompson?s sister, had been forced to leave town during a mining slump. Her family had only been able to return many years later, but her husband was now working at the coal mine that was slated to be closed.Many end up moving away for good, but the ones who stay or return are fiercely committed to the landscape and the isolation, the need for self-reliance. The nearest Walmart is more than two hours away. On the mile marker partway down the winding 100-mile road that leads to the closest hospital, locals have tied a pink ribbon to commemorate the place where a healthy little girl had recently been born.Grand Junction, that nearest larger town, has a population of just over 60,000. Several Nucla residents told me, with disgust, that they could not imagine living in a town that big, and some said they tried to visit as little as possible. Multiple men confided woefully that Nucla had a hard time attracting managers for certain jobs because their wives could not bear to live so far away from a shopping centre.Today, western Colorado is perceived as a conservative region. At a Blues in the Park night in Naturita, a stranger visiting the town, red-faced and somewhat inebriated, cornered me and began ranting about freeloading immigrants and American values. ?This country wasn?t built by socialists!? he told me. ?Actually,? I said politely, ?this area, right here, this was built by socialists.? In 1893, a financial crisis devastated thousands of companies and caused the unemployment rate to spike above 10% for several years. Workers lost their homes and families went hungry. According to one history of the town, a group of Denver families who had become homeless and who were ?united in their wish to escape tyrannical landlords? provided the impetus. In 1894, a group of 10 idealists in Denver formed the Colorado Co-Operative Company, with the goal of moving into the wilderness to create a new community ? a place ?where equality and service rather than greed and competition should be the basis?.The utopians spent nearly10 years digging an 18-mile irrigation canal through the arid landscape to bring water from the San Miguel river to the dry hill where they planned to build their colony. Money was tight, food scarce and the workers labored for shares in the eventual water rights in the canal they were digging by hand. To outsiders, the whole plan seemed like madness: how could anyone build a major irrigation canal without any capital? To expand their group of workers and supporters, the cooperative society established a newspaper, the Altrurian, to share news about their progress nationwide. It covered the day-to-day debates, including updates on the type of cabbages and lettuces that had been planted to feed the workers, as well as features on vegetarianism, marriage and violent labor strikes in other states. The paper advertised in-person cooperative club meetings across the country, including in Brooklyn, and was not too proud to beg for subscription pennies. ?If you have received one cent?s worth of information from this week?s Altrurian, and are not already a subscriber, can you not afford to be a subscriber?? it prompted.When the ditch was finished, the utopians named their town Nucla after the word nucleus, a strange premonition of the town?s nuclear future. Socialism broke down only a few years later. In 1914, Nucla voted down its ?single tax? system, in which the cooperative company owned all the land in town and paid one tax on it to the government, in favor of private ownership.Today, Thompson argues, it?s the labels on the town?s politics that have changed, more than the values themselves. The old-school cooperative mindset ?really maybe has more to do with conservatism than we think: independent, not needing the government, not needing a landlord, not needing a boss or a big corporation?.The ditch is still owned and managed collectively by the Colorado Co-operative Company, which the utopians founded in 1894. It has about 170 shareholders, and in the summer, group meetings have to be held late in the evening to make it easier for local ranchers to attend after work.Monte and his son Dean Naslund have a strong connection to the ditch: five generations of their family have worked rebuilding and maintaining it over the years.I drove out with Dean late one morning, after the day?s first real work had been done. The ditch was unlined, just a channel dug in the dirt, 16-20ft wide at the top, carefully designed to flow downhill all the way from the San Miguel river to Nucla.Naslund stopped periodically to use a pitchfork to clear branches out of ditch gratings. The back of the pickup was filled with tools, mixed with old chunks of red-and-black rock ? fossilized dinosaur bone, Naslund said. Golf balls sit near the front seat. He finds them ?floating down the ditch ? from Telluride, I suspect?.Golf balls aren?t the only trace of the liberal resort town that end up downstream in Nucla?s water. ?There?s been a few people who say they found some other things from Telluride,? Naslund said, and paused. ?Sexual endeavor things,? he added, delicately. Telluride, just an hour away, is Nucla?s polar opposite. The town, which hosts a film festival, is cosmopolitan and populated by the elite, a favored site for second or even third homes. Oprah Winfrey reportedly bought 60 acres of land there in 2014 and spent $14m on one of the town?s most lavish mansions (it has a wine cellar designed to look like a historic mine). To make ends meet, Nucla residents clean Telluride?s rental condos and help construct its elaborate mansions, with their enormous chandeliers and granite toilet seats and computerized bidets. One Nucla resident recalled walking into a bathroom in Telluride and feeling startled as ?the toilet opened by itself?.The class tensions between the two towns are exacerbated by stereotypes. Telluride people think the small towners? exposure to radiation means they ?can?t think properly?, said Kyle Webb, a 28-year-old who had moved from Denver to Nucla, in part because of its gun ordinance. Meanwhile, the avowed environmentalists are building giant mansions with heated driveways to melt the snow. Telluride is ?so wasteful ? and it?s kind of hypocritical?, said Aimee Tooker, Thompson?s niece and the the president of the West End Economic Development Corporation, which was founded to help build new economic models in the area.?It?s the saddest thing. You know, we turn off our lights. And as long as we have a place to plug in our phone and our TV, we?re happy. Those people that are up there ? they have rain sensors in their windows and sun sensors in their shades so that the shades will close automatically.?They?re the most wasteful people, yet they tell us that, you know, we can?t have our uranium, we can?t have this and that down here.? They?re the most wasteful people, yet they tell us that we can?t have our uranium, we can?t have this and that down hereThe two communities especially clashed during the push to reopen a uranium mill near Telluride, a raging fight that started around 2009. Hilary Cooper, a Telluride resident who was then the head of the Sheep Mountain Alliance, a Telluride environmental group, was one of the leaders who geared up to fight the uranium mill. ?I kind of jumped into those communities thinking, oh, we can talk some sense into these people: all the medical research and how bad this stuff was for them and how bad it was for the environment,? Cooper said. She knew the environmental arguments might not be as powerful, even if she stuck to the simple talking points of clean air and clean water. ?I could not have been more wrong in my approach,? she said.Her activism sparked outrage, and she said she received threats on her life. The children and grandchildren of Uravan miners had seen some of them die of lung cancer, but they never missed an opportunity to explain that they had been smokers too. The direct links they saw between exposure to uranium and cancer did not persuade them that uranium mining was a bad industry, especially with what the saw as more recent advances in safety. Thompson?s grandfather, who used to smoke and mine at the same time, had died of lung cancer. The local history museum has a photo of him smoking insouciantly while wheeling a cart of ore out of the mine. ?If you had told my grandpa that he was going to die when he was 70 a horrible, painful death, he would have continued to mine,? Thompson said. ?That?s how he supported his family and he was able to keep his family farm.? As an alternative to uranium, Telluride residents repeatedly suggested that Nucla and Naturita capitalize on the organic local food movement and return to their farming roots to provide Telluride and surrounding areas with produce, Cooper said.This suggestion was met with eye-rolling and frustration. ?I?ll be the first person in line to pick your tomatoes for $45,000 to $75,000 a year,? one local reportedly said in 2009, contrasting agricultural wages with mining income. Years later, Thompson still scoffs at the mention of organic produce. Her grandmother grew her own food and canned it, and never used pesticides. ?This is our way of life,? she said. After several years of angry public hearings, lawsuits and debates, the uranium project has been put on hold for economic reasons. In Nucla, where the spot price of uranium is printed on the front page of the newspaper, locals say it needs to reach $50 for the mill to be financially viable. The price listed on the paper in late June was $19.85. ?Telluride says a lot of dumb things,? said Paul Major, the president of the Telluride Foundation, a community philanthropy. ?You know, it?s easier to sit in Telluride and yodel about going green, and a community like Nucla is going, ?What are you talking about?? We?re just trying to put food on our table and a roof over our heads.??It was not easy for people working in information industries, or in tourism and real estate, to understand what it was like to be dependent on extraction industries, he said. If you had told my grandpa he was going to die a horrible,painful death at 70, he would have continued to mineThompson said that during a tour of Urvan for Telluride schoolchildren, their teacher asked her: ?So how do you kind of live with yourself, knowing that the town where you grew up in is where the bomb came from that killed all those people in Japan?? Thompson said: ?And I just looked at him, like, are you just stupid or are you just rude? What kind of question is that??My grandfather was a farmer, he was a kind and gentle man that wouldn?t hurt a fly ... He had no idea what he was doing. None of them knew what they were doing.?I had a hard time with that man even asking me that question.? Cooper, who was recently elected as a county commissioner in a neighboring county, representing Telluride, said she has learned the limits of the town?s helpful suggestions. ?Telluride is very well meaning in a patriarchal kind of way. We?ve got all kinds of ideas about what would be good for the West End. Unless it comes from within the West End, our ideas are not going to fly there,? she said. She thought some of the criticisms of the resort town have merit. ?I, too, am frustrated with Telluride?s energy use and with the 19-bedroom second homes that are still consuming energy when nobody is in the house year round. That said, don?t let that stop a good idea from happening. Don?t use that as an excuse not to move forward with something that would help your community.?Lacey Steele, a Nucla native, has been commuting to work in Telluride since she was 15 and now works at a Starbucks there. At 21, she?s starting a family and getting ready to have a baby. ?Everybody there looks down on it ? young marriage and young families,? she said. She?s one of the only people at work who?s preparing to have children at all.She sees an imbalance of power even in the way the residents of the two towns think of each other. ?I don?t believe that a lot of people in Telluride know what goes on around here. A lot of them don?t even know where we are.? And some of the work its millionaire tourist economy offers has real drawbacks: it?s seasonal, which means Steele is laid off twice a year in the spring and fall and then re-hired.Laura Denney, a Nucla resident who does private housekeeping in Telluride, said there is an ?amazing difference? in lifestyles between the two towns. At the same time, she said, the families she worked for were ?really down-to-earth people? who she saw give back to the broader community. She pushed back against the negative views of Telluride residents in Nucla. ?A lot of people still have that feeling: ?They?re just a bunch of hippies up there, just a bunch of rich people.? You know what? It was the hippies that made Telluride rich ... If it wasn?t for the people in Telluride, a lot of us here in Nucla, Naturita and Norwood wouldn?t have jobs.?Residents of Nucla ?do have this really strong attachment to their culture and their history?, Cooper said. Over the years, she?s come to believe that attachment is mixed with shame. The history of Nucla ?is not taught in schools, it?s not shared ... There?s a conflict of being both ashamed and being proud of it ? and I think in some ways that is what has really kept that community from discovering what?s next for them if it?s not uranium.?Jeremy Nichols, the climate energy program director at WildEarth Guardians, the not-for-profit whose lawsuit led to the closure of Nucla?s power plant, is unabashed about his goals. ?We want to shut down all coal-fired power plants. We want to keep all coal in the ground. We have a moral imperative to confront the climate crisis, and we can?t afford to say, ?It?s OK for this power plant to run and not the others.??The scheduled shutdown is ?an uncomfortable situation for sure for them?, he said. But the timeline, and the deadline, also have benefits, he argued. They provide certainty about something that was already going to happen, and cut through the rhetoric that might suggest, inaccurately, ?that coal is great and it?s going to go on forever and if anybody says otherwise, they?re lying?.The town has to take responsibility for planning its own future, and for the lack of planning in the past. ?It?s a beautiful landscape, but it?s stuck in an old economy, and the old economy is going belly-up, and Nucla hasn?t planned for that,? he said.One autumn 16 years ago, Monte Naslund, whose family has worked on the irrigation ditch for decades, was at cow camp, where cattle graze in the summer in the mountains near Nucla. It was always quiet up there, but on that day he noticed something different. The rumble of airplanes overhead, a constant background buzz even on a mountaintop, had stopped. He was listening to a depth of silence he had not heard since he was a boy.Only much later, when he came down off the mountain, would Naslund learn why it was so silent. Terrorists had flown airplanes into both the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and civilian flights had been grounded nationwide. More than 2,000 miles from the stunned New Yorkers who had watched the towers fall, Naslund had been able to hear the nation coming to a halt. Around Nucla these days, there?s a sense that many of the residents are listening intensely ? that the seismic shift they are experiencing, as urban and rural priorities clash across the world, is audible to them. Some in town are optimistic that they will find a way forward: expand the Nucla airport for commercial flights, turn the old elementary school building into a hemp manufacturing center, finally mobilize tourism to Nucla?s canyons, rivers and bike trails. Others are doubtful that hemp will make much difference, and question whether Nucla?s natural landscape ? beautiful, but without the show-stopping monuments of Moab or Zion ? could ever become a true tourist destination. The town lies off the highway; it is not on the way to anywhere. Miller, who runs an Airbnb in her house, said the guests she gets stay for just one night, stopping over on their way somewhere else.Thompson, who is also the president of the local historical society, is doing what she can to celebrate the town?s more positive history. There is a Uravan reunion picnic every year to bring together old residents of the town. In 2012, the event had attracted an estimated 1,000 people. They served yellow cake in tribute to yellowcake (milled uranium oxide). In the fall, she?s planning to host an all-terrain-vehicle tour of the entire length of the socialist ditch. But progress on building a larger museum is slow and after years of effort, Thompson said that Nucla and Naturita still feel like an afterthought to the broader world, their culture and history less of a priority. ?We really are a lower class people. I don?t know how to say that in a nice way,? she said.For Cooper, the Telluride commissioner, Nucla was founded with a pioneering spirit, and its residents still have it. ?If they could tap into that and take advantage of it,? she said, ?I think the sky?s the limit.?This article was co-published with Topic, a new storytelling studio.

Drugs (pseudoephedrine and ephedrine) weighing over 32 kgs have also been seized by the sleuths of the Delhi zonal unit of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in three separate operations launched by them since yesterday. All the four have been apprehended from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in the last 24 hours while they were trying to fly out to various foreign destinations with the contraband concealed in their bags, a senior NCB officer said.

', 'From this academic year, two more subjects ? science and English (third language), for non-English speakers ? will be added to the competency tests introduced two years ago to assess pupils from classes 1 to 8 in basic skills. Teachers will need to use a mobile application developed by the state to get instant results of the tests.In an attempt to iron out the flaws in the implementation of the tests, the state?s school education department passed a government resolution issued on Friday, making several changes to the structure of the exams and increasing supervision.Although the tests started in 2015 by Vinod Tawde, education minister, educators have repeatedly criticised the government for holding them in a haphazard manner. Schools were found to be sharing the papers with students before the exams and in some areas they were being openly sold in the market.The government has decided to test students in science and English (third language) as surveys show that students are weak in these subjects. An Annual Status of Education Report (2016) showed that only 62.5% students in class 5 can read. This is much lower than the national average of 47.8%. Similarly, the number of students who can divide was 20.3%, while it was 25. 9% nationally.?It is necessary to develop students competencies in science and English along with math and other languages,? said said Nand Kumar, principal secretary of the department. ?English proficiency is needed in today?s world. Science skills are equally essential,? he added.Results of the state achievement surveys and competency tests revealed slight improvement in first language and math competencies, language skills improved by 6.08% and numerical skills by 4.02% in the past two years in the tests held in 2016-17 and 2015-2016.To ensure that schools conduct the tests in a fair manner, the GR has asked that centre heads should be appointed in schools to supervise the exams. A month after the exams, they will randomly test students in the same subjects to see if the scores are accurate. If a difference of more than 20% is recorded, then the teachers will be trained in evaluating students.Schools, however, are worried this will increase the number of exams in an academic year. ?Students will be burdened by the additional exams, it will increase their stress,? said Uday Nare, senior teacher, Hansraj Morarji Public School, Andheri. The department needs to find ways of assessment without adding exams to the calendar, he said.

ANI?quoted Mayawati as saying shortly after she submitted her letter of resignation to the Rajya Sabha secretary general Shamsher Shariff?s office at around 5pm. Read | What BSP chief Mayawati?s threat to quit Rajya Sabha meansThe Rajya Sabha session began at 11am, and shortly afterwards Mayawati began speaking on atrocities against Dalits after being given 3 minutes to raise the issue. As she went past the scheduled time, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman PJ Kurien stopped her and an angry Mayawati stormed out of the House threatening to resign. In her 3-page resignation letter, she detailed the morning?s incident as the reason for her decision, which technically is a breach of protocol. A parliamentarian cannot cite a motive or reason for quitting, parliamentary procedure dictates. If people in power, the Bharatiya Janata Party or the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) does not allow me to speak in the interest of marginalised communities, then I can no longer continue in this Parliament, she said in the letter written in Hindi.Minister of state for parliamentary affairs Mukthar Abbas Naqvi said Mayawati had insulted the chair by threatening to resign. ?She must apologise.?He said the government was prepared to raise all issues. Opposition leader Ghulam Nabi Azad supported Mayawati and took objection to Naqvi?s remarks. ?When Mayawati tried to talk, she was told we have got the mandate. We did not know the BJP has got the mandate to massacre minorities and Dalits,? Azad, a Congress leader, said amid interruptions by the treasury benches. If her resignation is accepted, the BSP as well as the Opposition will lose an MP while the BJP in UP will bag the seat. Rajya Sabha members are elected by MLAs of the state and in UP, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP has a brute majority.The BSP chief?s term is going to end in April 2018. Given that her party has just 19 MLAs in the 403 member-strong assembly, the Dalit leader is unlikely to get any seat in the biennial polls in April. Her party has no member in the Lok Sabha, and observers say her focus on Dalit atrocities is part of a strategy for her to claw back political mileage.', 'Berlin/ New Delhi, Mar 8 (PTI) Qatar Airways plans to set up an airline in India along with the Gulf nations sovereign wealth fund, its chief executive Akbar Al Baker said today. This will be the first of its kind airline venture in India that would be fully-owned by overseas entities and the proposal comes nearly nine months after the Indian government allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the airlines segment. Qatar Airways, which is among the top three Gulf carriers, has been exploring investment opportunities in the fast- growing Indian aviation market. \"We are joining hands with the investment arm of State of Qatar to start a domestic airline in India with a 100 per cent investment,\" Al Baker said at a press meet in Berlin. \"We are doing this because Indian government has opened up the foreign direct investment in (setting up) an airline in India,\" he added. While announcing the plan, Al Baker said it is yet to apply to the Indian government. Last June, India allowed foreign investors -- barring overseas airlines -- to own up to 100 per cent stake in local carriers by liberalising FDI regulations. Currently, foreign airlines are allowed to invest only up to 49 per cent in Indian carriers. However, the revised norms provide room for overseas airlines to partner with a foreign non-airline player to set up a 100 per cent foreign-owned carrier in India.

When Vidya agreed to the selfie, she realised the man had put his arm around her. She objected to it, saying, \"Don\\'t.\" The man took off his arm but put it back around her again before clicking the photo.This is when Vidya lost it.

Prosecutors had recommended the governor instead face a sentence of two years? probation, and one year in jail if he reoffended. But the judges ? citing among others the ?expert? opinion of an Islamic vigilante group leader ? said they found the minority governor convincingly guilty of blasphemy, incarcerating him for two years. Ahok for months faced the wrath of hardline Islamists after he cited a Qur?anic verse on the campaign trail last September. The verse, he said, had been manipulated by some religious leaders to justify the claim the Muslims should not vote for non-Muslim leaders.Uproar over an edited version of the speech that went viral spilled into a series of angry mass rallies spearheaded by Islamists since late last year, and has catalysed the deepening of religious and ethnic divides in the capital.Some observers argue that religious hardliners may have swayed the Indonesian judiciary.International human rights organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the verdict would tarnish Indonesia?s reputation for religious tolerance and pluralism, and urged the country to repeal its ?unjust? blasphemy law. Ahok has indicated he will appeal against the ruling.\", \"Hot on the heels of Nokia, LG and Huawei's, Sony has unveiled their latest Xperia flagship Smartphone - the Xperia XZ Premium at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona. The Xperia XZ Premium is undoubtedly the company's most exciting device in years and comes with a range of breakthrough features, the chief amongst them being the world's first 4K HDR display in a smartphone.Â\\xa0Unlike the LG G6, which has eschewed Qualcomm's latest processor - the Snapdragon 835 in favour of the older Snapdragon 821 in order to gain the first mover advantage over the Galaxy S8, Sony has decided to stick with the 835 for the XZ Premium.The catch here is the fact that the XZ Premium will not be out before Spring, which is quite some time away. Additionally, the smartphone comes with 4GB of RAM, a 3,230mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0 support and Android 7.0 out of the box. As with previous Xperia's, the power button doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. Also Read:  Nokia 3310 relaunched: What is its price and other questions answeredTouted as a 'game-changing camera', the Sony Xperia XZ Premium comes with an entirely new camera system called the 'Motion Eye' which comes with the world's first memory stacked sensor. Sony has embedded fast memory right into the camera stack which allows the smartphone to capture video at an astonishing 960 frames per second, which is 4 times slower than any other smartphone available today. Sony claims that the ' World's fastest image capture technology in a smartphone' allows the camera to capture instances that occur in the blink of an eye and reveal things beyond what the human vision is capable of seeing. The added memory also brings with it improved predictive capture in the XZ Premium. The device starts to buffer images the moment it detects motion and selects 4 of the best photos by analysing the speed of the moving object.Additionally, the XZ Premium also comes with the same triple-sensor system found in the Xperia XZ, although the sensor's resolution has been reduced slightly to 19 megapixels. It has an aperture of f/2.0 and comes with SteadyShot and an 'Anti-distortion' shutter. On the front, there is a 13MP camera with an aperture of f/2.0 for selfies.Along with the camera, the display is what sets the XZ Premium apart from the competition. It is the first smartphone in the world to come with a 4K HDR display which is 5.5' in size and is also 40% brighter than the Xperia Z5 Premium's panel.The problem with the Xperia Z5 Premium was the fact that there was little or no 4K content available to enjoy on the smartphone. To remedy this, Sony has entered into a partnership with Amazon Prime Video where users will be able to enjoy a selection of 4K HDR content on their smartphones.Lastly, Sony has entered into a partnership with Qualcomm in order to create a new class of devices that are capable of gigabit LTE speeds. The XZ Premium will be the first smartphone to feature the same and offer not only high speeds but much better speeds everywhere. \", 'App-based cab aggregator Uber has hiked fares of its entry and premium level services by up to 50% in Delhi-NCR.The US-based firm has increased ride time charge to Rs1.5 per minute from Rs1 earlier for its UberGO and UberX services.

Those who...want to get the radiation level checked of towers will be done by the government and he will be informed,\" Union Minister of State for Communications Manoj Sinha told reporters here. Telecom Secretary J S Deepak said, a fee of Rs 5,000 would be charged for the test to be conducted by the government. \"We conduct test on random basis and through this portal and on payment, test of specific tower would be done,\" he added. Addressing an awareness programme on EMF emissions and telecom towers, the minister said, there are myths about the radiation and its impact on health which need to be eliminated by creating awareness. \"Mobile connectivity and broadband are a necessity today and without infrastructure for this, we can not make our society cashless. There is a misconception...that electromagnetic emission from towers cause adverse impact on health. There are studies conducted by WHO and various countries but no study has so far established this fact,\" the minister claimed. Sinha further said that permissible limit for the radiation in India is ten times less than those in other countries. \"It is necessary to install more towers to meet todays demand but due to this myth, there are difficulties in installing new towers. We want to create awareness among the people. The government is responsible and concerned for public health but some misconceptions prevail and they need to be addressed by awareness,\" he said.

Critics said a more distinguished historical figure would be more appropriate. Petitions were started for and against the change.Ronaldo acknowledged that it was rare for a public figure to be honoured while still alive, saying he was aware that some people didn?t agree with the name change. However, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said the tribute was legitimate because it was decided by an elected government.Ronaldo, Rebelo de Sousa said in his speech, is ?an example of excellence? and ?projects Madeira and Portugal across the world far more than anybody else.?Ronaldo is not the first football player with his name on an airport.

The 8-km extension will pass through the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) on the eastern waterfront. Officials haven?t planned how much of the extension will be elevated and how much of it will be underground. The extension is being planned to provide connectivity up to south Mumbai via port land, which is going to be developed as a ?second Marine Drive? by MbPT.?The south Mumbai extension will be partially underground. The corridor will be taken underground wherever we can?t make it elevated. A detailed report is expected in September,? said Pravin Darade, additional metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA.Senior MbPT officials are keen on an underground corridor for the stretch that passes through its land. MbPT is currently carrying out a study on how to commercially exploit the its 550-hectare land parcel. They have envisaged to revamp the eastern waterfront into a hub of recreation and entertainment. ?MbPT has conveyed to the MMRDA that it would like an underground line, but the final decision will be taken once the report is out,? said a senior official.Officials added MbPT will share the project cost as the extension would help them get footfalls when port trust land is developed commercially. According to officials, the per km cost for the elevated corridor is estimated to be Rs300 crore and Rs750 crore for the underground portion.With the extension of the Metro 4, there would be two Metro lines operating in south Mumbai.

Sanjay Dutt who raised the issue in the upper house said, ?The defamatory reference to former PM Indira Gandhi while mentioning the Emergency and Rajiv Gandhi about Bofors in the state school board?s history and political science textbook for Class 9 should be removed. This is the state government?s attempt to drive political influence and will not be tolerated.? Legislators from the Congress as well as the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supported the demand, saying there is little description of all significant achievements of Congress and NCP leaders in the textbooks. State school education minister Vinod Tawde said the minister does not have any role in it and the textbooks are written by a committee of experts. ?I don?t have the authority to scrap anything from textbooks or make changes. I will convey the sentiments of the house to the committee. There is absolutely no political interference,? Tawde said. The BJP minister said it is unfair to say the government has omitted the description of significant achievements of Congress and NCP leaders. ?The textbook has references to Indira Gandhi?s role in privatization of banks, creation of Bangladesh or Rajiv Gandhi?s approach in the conflict in Sri Lanka and so on,? he said.', 'India is all set to launch communication satellite GSAT-19 into space today using a monster rocket.

', 'Bengaluru, Jul 20 (PTI) A musician played the guitar on the operation table as he underwent a surgery at a private hospital here for a rare movement disorder affecting guitarists. The successful brain circuit surgery, believed to be the first such operation in the country, was performed on July 11 by a team of doctors from Bhagawan Mahaveer Jain Hospital on 37-year-old Abishek Prasad, who has a passion for the guitar, to rid him of the neurological disorder guitarist dystonia that had crippled his fingers. During the entire surgery, the patient was fullyÂ\\xa0awake and was playing the guitar as the problem only occurredÂ\\xa0when he tried playing guitar. So the feedback from theÂ\\xa0patient was important to get the exact location of the target, doctors told reporters here today. Expressing joy over the successful procedure, Prasad, a native of Bihar, said even the doctor did not expect 100 per cent result. \"It was a great feeling for both me andÂ\\xa0the doctor. It was 100 per cent result on the operation tableÂ\\xa0itself. Im very excited, finally now I can live my dream, can play my guitar again after one month of recovery... \"Now my fingers are completely listening to me,Â\\xa0earlier my fingers were erect and changing from one chord toÂ\\xa0other was difficult,\" he added. Prasad had developed the problemÂ\\xa0with his left hand fingers resulting in difficulty to move hisÂ\\xa0little finger, and the trouble grew gradually into disabilityÂ\\xa0because of which he had to abandon playing guitar. After consulting various specialists, PrasadÂ\\xa0was referred to the doctors at the BMJ hospital here. Calling it a rare disorder, neurologistÂ\\xa0Dr Sanjiv C C who specialises in movement disorders, said itÂ\\xa0occurs to one per cent among professional musicians. \"If the medical management that included BotulinumÂ\\xa0toxin and drugs fails, then surgery is the next option,\" heÂ\\xa0said. ', 'From Seema Hakhu Kachru Houston, Jan 13 (PTI) In a heartwarming open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama, former first daughters Barbara Bush and Jenna Bush Hager shared a bit of advice to the girls as they join \"another rarified club, one of former First Children\". \"We have watched you grow from girls to impressive young women with grace and ease,\" the Bush sisters wrote in aÂ\\xa0letter to the Obama girls. \"Now you are about to join another rarified club, one of former First Children ? a position you didnt seek and one with no guidelines. But you have so much to look forward to,\" it said. \"You will be writing the story of your lives, beyond the shadow of your famous parents, yet you will always carry with you the experiences of the past eight years,\" the Bushes wrote in their letter published yesterday in Time magazine. The Bush daughters, who first became familiar with the White House during the presidency of their grandfather, George H W Bush, recalled returning to the executive mansion in 2008 as young women to show the Obama girls around. They gave them a tour of bedrooms that once belonged to them and showed them how to slide down the banister of the solarium. \"In eight years, you have done so much. Seen so much,\" the Bush sisters write, noting Malia and Sashas meeting with Nelson Mandela in the cell where he was imprisoned for decades, as well as trips with their mother to Liberia and Morocco to speak with girls about the importance of education. The Bush sisters stress to 15-year-old Sasha, and 18-year-old Malia, that there is much to look forward to, but urge them to keep close in their hearts the experiences of the past two terms. One bit of advice was to stay in touch with those White House staff who made them feel at home and those who helped protect them. As Malia prepares to attend college this fall at Harvard, while Sasha remains in Washington to finish high school, they encourage the sisters to enjoy this youthful period of their lives. \"And you wont have the weight of the world on your young shoulders anymore. Explore your passions. Learn who you are. Make mistakes ? you are allowed to.\" \"Enjoy college. As most of the world knows, we did,\" they say, a nod to the much-reported brushes with the law both Bush twins experienced while drinking underage.

Authorities on Monday afternoon downgraded earlier reports of two victims with serious injuries.Police believe the attack was directly targeted at the insurance company but could not comment further on a possible motive while the attacker remained on the run.?This is not an attack against a hypothetical person. This is clearly against people from the insurer,? Major Ravi Landolt of the police told a news conference.Police spokesperson Cindy Beer confirmed that the incident was not being treated as a terrorist attack.Emergency services had been informed of the incident at 10.39am (0839 GMT) but found that the perpetrator had left the scene of the crime by the time police arrived.Schaffhausen?s old town has been sealed off as police continue to search for the perpetrator in the centre and vicinity of Switzerland?s northernmost city.Wrousis, described as an approximately 1.9m tall male, bald and of ?unkempt appearance?, was already known to police in relation with two offences against the country?s weapons law, in 2014 and 2016. Police were able to release several close-up pictures of the wanted man.Having previously been registered in the canton of GraubÃ¼nden, Wrousis had recently been without fixed abode and is believed to have lived in a stretch of forest 2km outside Schaffhausen.The municipal mayor said Wrousis had left a confused impression on the local population: ?He told my dog that he had a great haircut,? Ruedi Karre told news portal 24 Minuten.A white Volkswagen Caddy vehicle with a GraubÃ¼nden number plate previously used by Wrousis was later discovered in the city.Schaffhausen state prosecutor Peter Stichler appealed for caution among the local population, saying that Wrousis could act aggressively when cornered.

However, swift action by Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) led to their arrest at Mumbai airport.The diamond, worth Rs34 lakh, was recovered from a bottle of shampoo.The CISF later also provided security at the India International Jewellery Show (IIJS)-2017, which was being held at Bombay Exhibition Center, Goregaon. ?On July 31, at 3:45 pm, Gem Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) informed us that two Chinese nationals, while trying to strike a deal, cleverly switched and replaced a diamond piece weighing 5.4 carats, approximately costing Rs34 lakhs, with a fake piece,? said a CISF official.As soon as the information was received, a combined team of CISF personnel and council members spread out in the hall to locate the Chinese nationals and prevent them from exiting the venue. Meanwhile, their photographs were also taken from the council registration office and provided at all the gates. Subsequently, their movements were traced through CCTV footage, wherein it was revealed that the two Chinese nationals had already left the show. ?Once it was established that they had left, their passport details, registration details and photographs were taken from the council and sent to the Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) Mumbai and CISF?s airport incharge,? the official added.On the basis of the information, the immigration officials were able to detect the two Chinese nationals who were to  board Air India flight AI 314 from Mumbai to Osaka via Delhi-Hongkong scheduled to depart at 7:45 pm. ?It was found that there were not carrying any check in luggage and only two small-shaving kit sized bags were in their possession. The individuals had also changed their clothes from what they were wearing at the exhibition,? the officer said.Because the size of the diamond was small, the X-ray machine could not detect it and therefore, they were then interrogated with the help of a Chinese interpreter, after being off-loaded from the plane.During interrogation, they revealed that the diamond was concealed in a small shampoo bottle, which was subsequently recovered.', 'to 5 years RI Kolkata, May 8 (PTI) Calcutta High Court judge Justice C S Karnan, who is facing contempt charges, today \"sentenced\" Chief Justice of India J S Khehar and seven other judges of the Supreme Court to five years rigorous imprisonment.

Gaikwad had been barred from flying by Air India and the FIA after he repeatedly hit an Air India staffer during an argument on March 23. On Friday, the Osmanabad MP wrote to the Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju expressing \\'regret\\' for the incident, which grabbed national headlines.Following his Parliament statement, the Minsitry of Civil Aviation ordered the national carrier to lift its fly ban on Gaikwad.

Minutes into the argument, Gaikwad started slapping a 60-year-old Air India staffer with his slippers. The airline registered a case with the Delhi Police and proceeded to impose a fly ban on him the next day. The following two weeks saw much controversy with private airliners joining Air India\\'s stand even as the brazen MP refused to apologise.

I have instructed my staff to identify the properties that belong to two sand mafia groups. If they do not pay the penalty, we will auction their property,?  said BN Singh, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar. . Residents of the villages near the floodplains feel that there is a dire need to have night patrolling as sand mining mostly takes place at night.?Sand mafia groups transports the sand in dumpers at night. It happens with the involvement of the local police. If the administration wants to stop sand mining, it should ensure that the police stop supporting the sand mafia,? said Tikam Singh, a resident of Nagli village. The administration said they get information about sand mining activities from the villagers who live along the Yamuna embankment. ?Any person can share information about sand mining with our officers or with me. We will ban illegal sand mining and take appropriate action on residents? complaints,? the DM said. The administration will also confiscate properties of those part of the sand mafia in order to recover revenue lost as a result of the illegal sand mining activity.

Our priority is to ensure that no illegal sand mining takes place on the Yamuna floodplains,? BN Singh said. The DM has instructed all subdivisional magistrates to prepare a list of those involved in illegal sand mining in their respective areas.

Singh said. Illegal sand mining has been a lucrative business in Gautam Budh Nagar district, especially because sand is in huge demand for the construction activities in Delhi-NCR. As a result, trhe sand is almost worth its weight in gold. A dumper load of sand costs from Rs1,800 to Rs 2,000. To mine sand illegally, the sand mafia had even built a temporary bridge across the Yamuna to ferry sand from UP to Haryana. Authorities in Gautam Budh Nagar district in October, 2015, had caught about 30 labourers who were building the temporary bridge across the river to ferry sand. The district administration had dismantled the 300metre structure constructed near Noida?s Chak Basantpur village for trucks and dumpers carrying the coveted natural resource. The administration had also seized around 6,000 sandbags, several concrete pipes and an excavator as well. Later, the National Green Tribunal bar council had filed a petition in the tribunal which banned sand mining on Yamuna floodplains.

Your assessment of the day\\'s play?Sourav Ganguly: I think the pitch played superbly that\\'s what you expect on Day 1 of a Test match in India and Australia dominated. Good toss to win which is always the case in India. Australia had the best part of the surface to play on.

But he\\'s answered everyone with a Test match hundred. (Steve Smith hits back hard after ugly DRS spat with 19th Test hundred)Rohan: What is Steve Smith doing differently to Virat Kohli? Why is Kohli not able to score runs while Smith has already slammed two hundreds?Ganguly: Virat Kohli will score I think it\\'s just one of those times when one person gets the runs and the other person doesn\\'t get runs. There will be a time when Virat Kohli will score and Steve Smith will not score runs. Steve Smith likes batting against India to be honest. Four hundreds on the 2014-15 series in Australia and then two hundreds here along with the 2015 World Cup semi-final hundred. He loves Indian bowling you have got to give him credit. His records phenomenal. 19 Test hundreds in just 53 Test matches that\\'s a fantastic record.Rohan: India\\'s intensity dropped in the final session of play on Day 1. Do you think that is because Kohli was not on the field?Ganguly: These are after thoughts to be honest. You have got to give credit to the way Maxwell and Smith batted. Yes the captain makes a difference but if he\\'s injured you know then Ajinkya Rahane takes on. But you\\'ve got to give credit to the way Maxwell and Smith batted.Rohan: Michael Clarke had recently said that David Warner should call Sourav and take tips on how to bat against spinners.

The state carrier, which had grounded the MP for abusing and assaulting a 60-year-old Air India manager last week, first cancelled Gaikwad?s Mumbai-Delhi ticket and then another ticket that he had booked from Hyderabad to Delhi on Tuesday. The Sena MP, against whom police have filed an?FIR,?again tried booking a Nagpur-Mumbai-Delhi flight on Wednesday.?Ravindra Gaikwad, R Gaikwad, Prof V Ravindra Gaikwad and Prof Ravindra Gaikwad has been banned in our system as he tried booking using different abbreviation. In some cases he tried changing spellings of Gaikwad also. We are scanning all the details as bookings are made through coupon issued by Parliament,? said an Air India official. Gaikwad had an open ticket with Air India and had booked a flight for Wednesday morning. He blocked a seat on a morning flight from Mumbai to Delhi, which was booked through the Air India call centre. When the airline realised who the passenger was, they cancelled the ticket. Not one to give up, Gaikwad then booked another ticket, this time from Hyderabad to Delhi. However, the airline again came to know who the passenger was and cancelled the ticket once again. On Wednesday, he tried booking through an agent who contacted the AI headquarter in Nagpur. ?A confirmation was sought from headquarter and the travel agent refused to book his ticket,? the official said. Gaikwad abused and assaulted Air India?s duty manager R Sukumar with slippers after being denied business class seat on a Pune-New Delhi Air India flight last Thursday.The 56-year-old MP was then banned by Air India and five private airlines from flying as he refused to apologise for the incident that triggered nationwide outrage.Fellow MPs criticised Gaikwad?s action, and Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan said she will take a call if any parliamentarian brought the topic to her notice in the House. He, however, remained defiant  and, instead, blamed Sukumar for the incident.He told reporters at Maharashtra Sadan on Thursday morning that he has no regrets. ?Kaahe ka pashchaataap (what is there to repent)? I will not apologise ... he (Sukumar) should come and apologise. Then we will see. A 60-year-old man should know how to behave,? he said.', 'An 80-year-old woman in Bhopal has alleged that a group of four-five policemen barged into her house and beat her with sticks, breaking her bones and grievously injuring her husband too.

The UP Chief Minister also said that if needed, the state government would make available additional funds under this head, but there should not be any problem of drinking water for the people and the cattle in Bundelkhand region. \"Adityanath is also expected to visit the region this month,\" a UP government spokesperson said. The UP Chief Minister said that Budelkhand was constinuously ignored in the last 15 years and no steps had been taken to ensure the wholistic development of the region. Adityanath said he was aware of the hardships faced by the people of the region. \"Now, the state government will make all efforts to ensure the development of the region in a planned manner,\" the spokesperson said quoting the Chief Minister. During his Deoria to Dilli Kisan Yatra in September, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had accused the Uttar Pradesh government of failing to improve situation in the Bundelkhand region, which was battling continuous drought. \"The requirement in Bundelkhand is different and it needs to be addressed differently,\" he had said at a khat sabha in Banda. Rahul had alleged that the Congress-led UPA government had given a special package to the area, but the SP government in Uttar Pradesh did not lend support to improve the situation in the region. In April last year, the Centre had said that farmers in Bundelkhand will get Rs 1,304 crore for drought relief under National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF). Also mandays under the MNREGA was increased to 150 as a review was undertaken by the Prime Ministers Office of the situation in the region. The CM also decided that the National Rural Livelihood Mission will be intensified and would be extended to all the blocks for alternative sources of income, construction of water tanks and building of dug wells and farm ponds on a priority basis under various projects and schemes for Bundelkhand. At a review meeting, held on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and attended by the Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh, it was decided that the Centre and the state government will work together for long-term sustainable solutions to address the problem of vulnerable regions in natural distress. In May 2016, a water train had led to a war of words between the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government when it arrived Jhansi without the \"promised\" 70,000 litres of water. The train was sent from Madhya Pradeshs Ratlam district for the drought-hit Bundelkhand on the instruction of Railway Board, days after a similar arrangement was made for Latur in Maharashtra. SP members on May 6, 2016 walked out of Rajya Sabha charging the Centre with playing petty politics by sending an empty water train to drought-hit Bundelkhand region.

In 1847 the Chinese Government admitted that this boundary was sufficiently and distinctly fixed. The area now claimed by China has always been depicted as part of India on official maps, has been surveyed by Indian officials and even a Chinese map of shows it as Indian territory.\"On the McMahon Line, Nehru wrote: \"The McMahon Line-As you are aware, the so-called McMahon Line runs eastwards from the eastern borders of Bhutan and defines the boundary of China on the one hand and on the India and Burma on the other. Contrary to what has been reported to you, this line was, in fact, drawn at a Tripartite Conference held at Simla in 1913-1914 between the Plenipotentiaries of the Governments of China, Tibet and India. At the time of acceptance of the delineation of this frontier, Lonchen Shatra, the Tibetan Plenipotentiary, in letters exchanged, stated explicitly that he had received orders from Lhasa to agree to the boundary as marked on the map appended to the Convention.\" China, however, does not recognise those two treaties.ALSO READ |China will defend territory even at the cost of war with India, says Chinese dailyBeyond Doka La: 10 irritants in India-China relationChina says 1890 treaty backs claims to Doklam plateau at trijunction', 'The Terminator actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and US President Donald Trump have been involved in a very public fallout.

Doctors treating her at a private hospital said on Thursday evening that she was stable and managed to speak though a blood clot was detected in her brain.Her uncle, HC Bhatia, told HT that she had received multiple injuries to her brain nerves.Kalra gained consciousness briefly on Wednesday night to tell police she was attacked, but fell unconscious soon after.Police said they registered a case of attempt to murder and that the attack was possibly carried out with iron rods but were clueless about possible suspects. ?We have no eyewitnesses of this attack.

(Young Women?s Cell) for the first time. The proposed unit will not be the part of either Mahila Morcha (Women?s Wing) or Yuva Morcha (Youth Wing), and will work as an independent division. The decision has been taken following the directions of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). A party leader privy to the development said Ram Lal, national general secretary (organisation) of the BJP, had asked the state leadership to expand its base among young females, especially those who stay at home. ?While interacting with the state leadership during party president Amit Shah?s pravas (stay) in Delhi last week, Ram Lalji directed to bring young women to party fold. His view was that there are women who are impressed with party?s policies and ideology, but they don?t come out for different reasons. A special drive should be initiated to persuade them to join the party,? the leader said. Following Ram Lal?s instruction, state unit chief Manoj Tiwari has directed its Youth Wing (all 14 district presidents) to carry out an identification drive. ?The members of the Youth Wing have been asked to prepare a list of women in the age group of 18-25 years and are willing to work for the outfit. In the first phase, the district or block level leaders will prepare a list. Thereafter, a detailed strategy will be chalked out for further course of action. They are specifically been told that no pressure should be put on anyone, and to invite only those who are keen to join,? said a party insider. The BJP leaders, justifying the move, said the proposed cell will facilitate to tap a large section of the society, which generally remains ?unattended?. ?Female students mostly go to the Youth Wing and to work with the Mahila Morcha, one should be aged 25. Therefore, a significant number of women in the age group of 18-25 years are not actively involved in political activities. The party now plans to focus on this age group to strengthen the organisation further in the city,? he said.', 'Security has been beefed up across major stations under the Eastern Railway after it received a \"threat letter\" at its headquarters in Kolkata on Friday.The letter which allegedly mentions the name of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad threatens to \"blow-up\" major stations such as Howrah and Sealdah.

The highest grade that the body gives is of A++, which no DU college has managed to secure in the latest rankings.Tested on parameters such as curriculum, teaching learning, evaluation, faculty research, infrastructure, learning resources, governance and student services,  only three out of the 62 colleges secured the second grade of A+.

Our method, ZeitZeiger, uses 15 genes from across the human genome to predict circadian time,\" he said. The researchers were surprised to find that 13 out of these 15 genes were not core genes of the human circadian clock. Core genes are necessary for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. They can be compared to the gears of a mechanical watch. \"Most of the genes that were selected for ZeitZeiger seem to be outputs of the clock; that is they are not the gears controlling the clock, but the hands telling the time. \"This shows that when given data for almost every gene in the genome, the algorithm can figure out which set of genes gives the best predictions, even if they are not core clock genes,\" Hughey said. In addition to predicting circadian time, the researchers demonstrated that ZeitZeiger can also be used to show how disruptions to sleep-wake and light-dark cycles affect the circadian clock. The rhythms produced by the circadian clock differ widely between individuals at any given time of day and they are often disrupted by modern environments, for example due to shift work or reduced exposure to sunlight. Circadian dysfunction is linked to conditions such as cancer, depressive disorder and obesity. Knowledge of an individuals circadian rhythms could be used to optimise the timing of therapeutic interventions, which is known as chronotherapy. ', 'A bitter stand-off between a local community and miners has emerged after a significant seam of gold was found on protected conservation land in New Zealand?s North Island.Last week New Talisman Gold Mines reported they had found a large vein of gold in the Karangahake Gorge in the North Island; 8,500kg of highest quality gold which put it in the top five percent of deposits worldwide when ranked on grade, according to the company.The find is believed to be worth tens of millions of New Zealand dollars.Talisman?s general manager of operations Wayne Chowles said the company planned to begin extracting small amounts of gold early next year, but locals in opposition to the scheme have sprung into action, saying the mining project threatens the ?peace and harmony? of their ?sacred? mountain and community.The Karangahake Gorge lies on protected department of conservation land in the Coromandel peninsula and is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. Located one and a half hour?s drive from Auckland and 55 minutes from Hobbiton, the scenic gorge is famed for its rich history and lush natural beauty.But now the mining company and walkers are forced to share one narrow access road to the mountain.Chowles said there would be ?flow-down? benefits to the local community, and the footprint of the mining company in the reserve was ?small? at just 0.4 of a hectare with 95 percent of the proposed mining activity taking place underground. The company says the mine?s water supply was also processed through a ?closed loop system?. ?We do not believe that our activities have, or will, significantly disrupt the peace and beauty of the gorge,? said Chowles.. But some locals stridently disagree. Ruby Jane Powell is a member of the protest group Protect Karangahake. The group has been opposing any mining action in the gorge for a number of years, but have ?doubled their efforts? this week to protect the land, sending dozens of protestors to block the access road, or slow down prospecting efforts by sending ?very slow walkers? to clog up the road and prevent vehicle access. ?We don?t want to take direct action but we are left with no choice, the government and the department of conservation have failed to protect this treasured land,? said Powell. ?It is a really popular recreation area, and the local water source is taken down-stream from the mine. In general our culture and economy is really interlinked with the eco-tourism and outdoor aspect of life in the Coromandel, and mining threatens that,? said Powell. The government and the department of conservation have failed to protect this treasured landPowell said communication between the community and New Talisman had broken down. ?The reality is that gold-mining makes money for a few people, but we are the ones that pay the cost, we will have to live with a degraded environment and an altered sense of peace in the mountain.?Green Party MP Catherine Delahunty said industrial scale gold mining on Karangahake mountain would ?turn a beautiful recreational park and sacred mountain into an industrial zone?.?This is public land which has been set aside to protect its ecological values and for recreation. It is a sacred mountain to the indigenous people of the area and local residents are actively and peacefully opposing the initial development of the mining activity on the mountain.?The New Zealand Government is also hell bent on opening up conservation areas to mining but they do not have a mandate to destroy our precious places ?New Talisman were granted a 25-year mining permit to prospect and mine on conservation land in Karangahake in 2009, using an existing underground mine that has been in operation at various times between 1892 and 1992. It is legal to mine on conservation land in New Zealand if the government and local council grant a permit and if land access is given from the department of conservation.As of May there were 43 active mines on conservation land in New Zealand, according to the ministry of business, innovation and employment.New Talisman have all the consents they need and the government insists mining activity won?t affect the historic gorge. The only thing standing in their path is local opposition.Powell has vowed to keep up the fight. ?We will continue to put our bodies on the line to stop New Talisman working in the mountain,? she said.Note: This article has been updated to add in extra information provided on Talisman?s mine.

Residents said the monsoon would have made entry to their residential complex an arduous affair if they had not taken this step.Cold mix asphalt is a combination of mineral aggregate and emulsified or cutback asphalt with additives.The residential society is located inside Nirvana Country and the 140-metre stretch connecting the society to the main road, was badly damaged and riddled with potholes.After the MCG allegedly refused to re-lay the road despite repeated requests, residents decided to collect money and run repairs on the stretch.

The fire department received information about the blaze at the factory of Avon Biwheeler Accessories Pvt Ltd around 8.30am.Since Manesar is an industrial area fire incidents are frequent there. A total of nine fire tenders from the fire departments in Gurgaon, Manesar and Maruti were dispatched and the fire was brought under control by 12.30pm.As the fire took place early morning, most workers were not present in the factory.?The first and ground floor of the factory were gutted and material worth of lakhs of rupees were burnt. We were able to prevent the fire from spreading to the basement and curtail further damage,? Sukhbir Yadav, assistant fire officer, Gurgaon, said.Fire department officials said they are examining the extent of damage from the owners and are verifying whether they had procured a no objection certificate from the fire department and received a fire safety clearance.On May 29, 2016, a major fire had broke out at the Manesar plant of Subros Limited, manufacturer of air conditioners and transport refrigerator systems. The plant is located near the site of Tuesday?s incident. The Subros plant was opened in March.A fire also broke out an auto manufacturing plant in Sector 4, Mansear, on June 16, 2015.

The other four men are still at large. The arrest of Sajid Khan came hours after the girl?s mother was shot at allegedly by two unidentified bike-borne men, some distance away from her home in Jamia Nagar. The police are probing Sajid?s role in the firing, though they believe that he was not present at the spot when the woman was shot at. The 47-year-old woman was on her way to a local hospital with her daughter at the time of the crime. Two bullets were fired on them. One of the rounds brushed against the woman?s hip. She was admitted to AIIMS and is undergoing treatment, said police. Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal visited the woman at AIIMS on Friday and said the women?s panel will set up a committee to look into the incident. RP Upadhyay, joint commissioner of police (southeastern range), said that Sajid was the main accused in the gang rape case and was absconding since the FIR was registered. ?Our teams were working on the case and collecting information about the suspects after the FIR was registered. Six raids were made over the past two weeks to nab them,? said Upadhyay.On Friday, DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya said, the investigating team received inputs about Sajid?s movements in Bijnor. A team was immediately dispatched. ?Raids were conducted at his possible hideouts and he was finally caught in the evening. We have brought him to Delhi and are interrogating him. He has confessed to having raped the minor girl,? added Baaniya. Sources said Sajid has denied his role in attack on the girl?s mother. Senior police officer said that they have identified the men who fired at the woman. ?Raids are on to nab them. They will be caught soon,? added Baaniya. The sexual assault on the girl first took place in July 2016 when Sajid allegedly raped her in his flat. She met him through her classmate. Sajid also made an MMS clip of the sexual assault and used it to blackmail her.

So, they began questioning people. After rounding off nearly all the Bangalore Turf Club employees who were living close to the premises in sheds, the police identified a few individuals who looked like the suspect in the CCTV footage.During the questioning, the police found out that one of the men has a very peculiar behaviour and that there were complaints that he would slip out in the idle of the night .Finally, the police identified Abu Taleem who confessed that he would wear the undergarments and later discard them only to go around stealing more.Taleem had devised quite a strategy to go about his obsession. He would wait for the other labourers to go to sleep. After which, he would powder his face and apply oil on his arms to allow him to slip faster in case he gets caught.Now that the pervert has been caught, the girls in the hostel can heave a sigh of relief. \", 'Bob Dylan made history last October by being named the first songwriter to win the prestigious Nobel Prize for Literature.

According to the woman, three men in a Maruti Swift car kidnapped her and drove her around on the streets of Sohna for several hours while repeatedly raped her. She was then driven all the way to Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh where she was thrown out of the car near Yatharh Hospital in Kasna. Based on the girl\\'s written statement, Noida police have filed a First Information Report under Indian Penal Code Section 376D, which deals with gangrape. WHAT HAPPENED? According to the woman\\'s statement, she was abducted by three men in a Swift car from near her home in Sohna, Gurgaon at 8.45 pm on Monday. The men then drove her around for four to five hours, taking turns to repeatedly molest and rape her. With the woman still in the car, the men then drove all the way to Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh where they flung her out of the car near the Yatharth Hospital in Kasna around 4 am. She recounted her horrific ordeal with locals in the area who then called the Noida police. Noida police reached the spot, informed their counterparts in Gurgaon and took the woman for a medical examination at Yatharth Hospital. Senior Superintendent of Police, Gautam Budh Nagar, Love Kumar told India Today that the woman was then taken back to Sohna to identify the spot from where she was abducted. Kumar also told India Today that there were certain discrepancies in the woman\\'s initial statements and the police was working to verify and corroborate her claims. It remains unclear what route the alleged rapists took while driving from Sohna to Greater Noida. Kumar said the police is working to establish how the woman was brought to Greater Noida. The woman hails from Rajasthan\\'s Bharatpur city and came to Sohna around 10-15 days ago and was staying with her family.DRUNK MEN?Meanwhile, initial investigation into the incident has indicated that the men were drunk or were drinking while the alleged gangrape occurred. Some beer bottles were also found from the spot which indicates that the accused persons were inebriated at the time,\" a senior Greater Noida police officer told news agency PTI.The men are also believed to have threatened the woman with dire consequences if she approached the police. While an FIR has been filed, no arrests have yet been made in the case. Police teams are examining CCTV footage to identify the route the Swift car took to travel the around 80-kilometer distance from Sohna to Greater Noida. The FIR has been registered by Noida police\\'s Kasna unit and Gurgaon police has said they will be assisting the Noida cops. \"We have taken the details from SSP Gautam Budh Nagar, Love Kumar. A team of the Gautambudh Nagar police is arriving in Gurgaon to examine the sequence of the crime. We are examining whether they lodged a zero FIR in this regard. We are assisting Noida police and are investigating the matter,\" Gurgaon Police Commissioner Sandeep Khirwar told PTI earlier in the day.Commenting on the alleged gangrape, Uttar Pradesh Health Minister and government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh told ANI that steps required under the law are being taken. The UP government will help the Haryana Police with whatever help they need to probe the incident, Singh said. COPS FOUND SLEEPING - UNRELATED INCIDENTWhile questions remain over how the alleged rapists were able to travel all the way from Gurgaon to Greater Noida without being stopped by cops, in an unrelated development, two Noida policemen stationed at a Police Control Room van were shunted out after they were found sleeping during the night.The Swift car in which the alleged gangrape occurred is not believed to have passed through the area in which PCR van was stationed.

The apex court has dealt with several such cases before but surprisingly it has not given a consistent interpretation of the laws and provisions of Constitution. The conflict arises when personal laws are perceived to be in violation of the fundamental rights.Article 13 of the Constitution states that any law, which goes against the provisions of fundamental rights, shall be void to the extent of contravention.SUPREME COURT\\'S STAND ON PERSONAL LAWSPersonal laws in India are codified and uncodified - existing in custom and practice. Over the years, the Supreme Court has taken differing views on the question of precedence of personal laws over the fundamental rights. In Krishna Singh vs Mathura Ahir case of 1980, Maharshi Avdesh case of 1994 and Ahmedabad Women Action Group case of 1997, the Supreme Court held that personal laws could not be challenged for being in contravention of the provisions of fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.Many believe that this interpretation of the Supreme Court has been based on a ruling of the Bombay High Court in Narsu Appa Mali case of 1951. In this case, the Bombay High Court has enunciated that personal laws are not \\'laws\\' under Article 13 of the Constitution.But, a three-Judge Supreme Court bench in Mudaliar case of 1996 held that personal laws are void to the extent that they are in violation of the fundamental rights.All these aspects and arguments are likely to be placed and reexamined the Supreme Court during the seven-day hearing of the triple talaq matter this summer.SOME RECENT CASES OF PERSONAL LAWS: SHAH BANO MATTERThe most famous case relating to personal laws was that of Shah Bano, who had fought long drawn legal battle seeking maintenance from her ex-husband. In 1985, the Supreme Court had directed Shah Bano\\'s husband to pay her alimony according to the laws applicable to other Indians.The Supreme Court had rejected the argument of Shah Bano\\'s ex-husband that since she was paid during the period of iddat - the waiting period after divorce and also the amount of mehr, she was not entitled to any further maintenance under the Muslim personal law.MARY ROY CASEThe very next year, the Supreme Court decided another case relating to Christian personal law in the 1986-case of Mary Roy. The Supreme Court ruled that Syrian Christian women were entitled to equal share in their father\\'s property.Before the Supreme Court order, the Syrian Christian community settled property inheritance issue as per the Travancore Succession Act, 1916 and Cochin Succession Act, 1921 while other Christians followed the Indian Succession Act of 1925 for the same. As per the Travancore and Cochin Acts, women received only a quarter of their male siblings or Rs 5,000 whichever was less.DANIAL LATIFI CASEDanial Latifi was the lawyer of Shah Bano, who has won a maintenance case against her ex-husband in the Supreme Court. But, the apex court verdict was not received well by the conservative segment of Muslim society.In order to pacify the swelling sentiment of the community, the then Rajiv Gandhi government enacted the Muslim Women (Protection on Divorce Act), 1986. The new Act overturned the judgment of the Supreme Court providing that a man was required to pay maintenance to his divorced wife only during the period of Iddat.Danial Latifi challenged the constitutional validity of the Personal law. The Supreme Court, in 2001 during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, held that the Muslim Women (Protection on Divorce Act), 1986 did not violate the Constitution or the fundamental rights.The Supreme Court maintained that the personal laws need not be tested on the touchstone of the provisions of the fundamental rights.TRIPLE TALAQ CASE IN BOMBAY HIGH COURTIn another case of triple talaq, the Bombay High Court held in 2002 that if wife contests this practice of divorce, it needed to be proved in a court of law. In its 88-page judgment, the Bombay High Court ruled that \"divorces between Muslims couples will now have to be convincingly proved under Civil Procedure Act and Indian Evidence Act. A mere statement, written or oral, by a Muslim man seeking divorce will not be enough proof of his having obtained the divorce.\"The Bombay High Court also held that a Muslim man did not have a unilateral right to divorce his wife by triple talaq. The man is bound to provide good reasons for a divorce.ADOPTION BY MUSLIM WOMENThe Supreme Court again delivered a landmark judgment in 2014 on the question of adoption of child by a Muslim woman. The Muslim personal law does not give women of the community the right to adopt children.A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the then Chief Justice of India P Sathasivam ruled that Muslim women had the right to legally adopt children like any other Indian citizen. The Supreme Court held that the right to adopt children could not be denied by Muslim personal law.RIGHT OF UNWED MOTHERUnder the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act of 1956 father was held as the natural guardian of a Hindu child. If a child was born out of wedlock, only then the mother could be considered a natural guardian.But, in 2015, the Supreme Court held that an unwed mother can legally become the sole guardian of a child. The apex court held the consent of the biological father is not necessary for the mother to become legal guardian of the child.The Supreme Court observed that the father could not have \\'a preferential right over the mother in the matter of guardianship\\'.ALSO READ |Triple talaq: Supreme Court begins hearing on whether it is fundamental to Islam', 'The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday revoked its decision to provide a dedicated corridor at toll plazas for lawmakers in case of traffic snarls, after drawing flak from the opposition.Additional Chief Secretary Sadakant issued letters to all district magistrates and divisional commissioners ?modifying? an advisory dated July 13, which he said had led to confusion and raised a number of questions.It was mentioned in the advisory that in case of long traffic jams at toll collection centres and plazas, there should be a provision for separate lane for VVIPs.?...it is being made clear that for the VVIPs, no separate lane at the toll plazas will be constructed.

Goel was held after Ghaziabad-based Ayam Enterprises filed an FIR on Wednesday alleging that Ringing Bells \"defrauded\" it of Rs 16 lakh.Last year Ringing Bells had created a sensation after it announced Freedom 251, a smartphone that it promised to sell at a price of Rs 251. The company took pre-orders from hundreds of thousands of people. However, so far it has failed to deliver the phones to most of these people who had pre-booked the device.Ghaziabad deputy SP Manish Mishra said Goel has been detained for interrogation in the matter.In the FIR, Ayam Enterprises has claimed it was persuaded by Goel and others from Ringing Bells to take up the distributorship of the Freedom 251 phones in November 2015.\"We paid Rs 30 lakh to Ringing Bells through RTGS on different occasions. But it delivered us product worth Rs 13 lakh only. Upon follow-up, we could get products plus money totalling Rs 14 lakh,\" it claimed in the FIR.The owners of Ayam Enterprises claim that they were threatened with life if they asked for the rest Rs 16 lakh \"again and again\".The Freedom 251 looked like a scam since very beginning. The phone was seemingly a re-branded Chinese phone that was picked up at a price of a few thousand rupees from Chinese market. However, these units were just the display units.

The investigators also alleged before Justice I S Mehta that Bharti, former Law Minister, used to harass and beat his wife Lipika Mitra, who has sought cancellation of his bail in a domestic violence case lodged by her. The MLA, who was granted bail on October 7, 2015 after being in jail for eight days, has denied the allegations levelled against him by his wife. His counsel today told the court that they would like to file a rejoinder. The police, which has filed its affidavit following the courts direction, also submitted in the court orally that an \"AIIMS medical board has opined that the scars on the womans body were due to dog bites and burn injuries\". The investigators had on April 5 last year filed the charge sheet in the case, mentioning that the woman had made an allegation that Bharti had endangered the life of an unborn child which she was carrying by unleashing his dog on her. The police said \"the AIIMS medical board had examined six photos, which are concerned with the treatment history of dog bite, prescribed by Ayushman hospital (in Dwarka) here. \"We are also of the opinion that the scar marks could be due to consequences of dog bite injuries,\" the police said in its affidavit. It also claimed that some of the injury marks were \"due to burns.\" In its affidavit, the police said \"Somnath Bharti used to harass, beat and abuse the petitioner (wife) from the very beginning of the marriage, despite having knowledge about her frail health conditions. \"The medical record produced by the petitioner (wife) was examined and verified and it shows that she was suffering from diabetes and hypertension at the time of pregnancy.\" It claimed there was sufficient evidence on record for alleged offences for attempt to murder, act done with intent to prevent child being born alive or to cause it to die after birth, causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means against the MLA from Malviya Nagar assembly. Further, the police said there was a case of alleged dowry harassment and criminal breach of trust alongwith the charge of cheating and criminal intimidation against him under the Indian Penal Code. Lipika had moved the high court challenging the bail order, saying it was almost like a verdict and the trial court had relied on the case diary which allegedly should not have been done at that stage. Bhartis wife had on June 10, 2015 lodged a complaint against him with the Delhi Commission for Women and an FIR was lodged by the Delhi Police on September 9, 2015 for allegedly subjecting her to domestic violence and trying to kill her. The AAP leader was arrested in the wee hours of September 29, 2015 after the Supreme Court had ordered him to surrender but was granted bail on October 7, 2015.

Stating that the countries all over the world have experimented with the concept of Right to Recall, the Lok Sabha MP has proposed an amendment in the Representation of the People Act 1951 through his Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 2016. As per the legislation, recalling process can be initiated by any voter of the constituency by filing a petition before the Speaker, signed by at least one-fourth of the total number of electors in that constituency. After confirming its authenticity, the Speaker will move the application to the Election Commission for its verification and authentication of the voters signatures on it. The Commission will verify the signatures on it and will organise the voting on 10 places in the respective constituency of MP or MLA, it says. If three-fourth of the votes that member was polled in his election, go in favour of the recall process, the member will be recalled, the bill proposes. Within 24 hours of the receipt of the result, the Speaker will notify the result to the general public. Once the seat gets duly vacated the Commission can organise a bypoll in that constituency. \"A free and fair election is the right of the citizens of the country and in the event of their elected representatives no longer enjoying their confidence, the people must have a right to remove them,\" Varun said.

On Saturday, the afforestation drive focused on colony parks and saw residents and members of market welfare associations participating.NDMC chairperson Naresh Kumar, who took part in the plantation drive at Ravinder Nagar colony near Khan Market, said it was a simple but positive step taken by RWAs to arrest the deterioration of ecological balance not only in the capital city but the whole world.?The green cover of any area not only attracts rainfall but also acts like the green lungs. It is the need of hour. We need to plant as many trees as possible and nurture them like our own children,? Kumar said.According to him, the idea behind the plantation drive undertaken by the NDMC during the monsoon season was to systematically engage stakeholders from all walks of life in New Delhi area.In this year?s plantation drive, the focus is on indigenous trees such as babul, ber, amaltas, keekar and peepal, which are native to the city and flourish in this weather.

Outside Tesla?s factory in Fremont, California on Friday night, Musk showed off the $35,000 Model 3 which has a range of 220 miles (350 km) on a charge that marks a departure from the company?s earlier luxury electric cars. Hours before the event, Musk acknowledged it would be ?quite a challenge? to build the car during the early days of production. ?We?re going to go through at least six months of manufacturing hell,? Musk told journalists. The over half a million reservations are up from about 373,000 disclosed in April 2016. Customers pay $1,000 refundable deposits for the car, which is eligible for tax credits. Any new buyers would likely not receive their car until the end of 2018, Musk said. A longer-range version of the car is priced at $44,000 and will drive 310 miles (500 km) on a single charge. The cars feature a streamlined dashboard devoid of buttons or knobs, with a touchstream display to the right of the driver.Tesla faces major hurdles living up to the Model 3 hype. The 500,000 vehicles Tesla vows to produce next year are nearly six times its 2016 production. Were Tesla to produce, and sell 500,000 cars per year, the company would likely outsell the BMW, Mercedes, or Lexus brands in the United States. Production delays and quality issues marred the launches of Tesla?s Model S and Model X vehicles, and the company blamed production problems for a shortfall during the second quarter of this year. Musk has said a simpler Model 3 design will greatly reduce potential assembly-line problems. Tesla has burned through more than $2bn in cash so far this year ahead of the launch. A troubled Model 3 launch could heighten the risks for the company, while a steady delivery of Model 3s could generate a stream of cash that would allow Tesla to avoid going again to the capital markets to fund its operations. Tesla?s share price has surged 54% since January in anticipation of the Model 3 launch, and Tesla?s pricey valuation now exceeds that of traditional rivals like General Motors and Ford . Until now, Tesla has operated as a niche producer of luxury electric vehicles, with a charismatic, showman chief executive who regularly interacts with fans on his Twitter account. Now loss-making Tesla is trying to move into a different league, building vehicles in high volume for customers able to pay only a few thousand dollars more than the average price of a conventional car or truck sold in the US. The Model 3 is part of Musk?s broader plan to build a clean energy and transportation company that offers electric semi trucks, rooftop solar energy systems and large-scale battery storage systems.', 'Parupalli Kashyap and HS Prannoy earned contrasting victories on Friday to enter the men?s singles semi-finals at the $120,000 US Open Grand Prix Gold badminton in Anaheim on Friday.Second seed Prannoy took exactly an hour to move past Japanese eighth seed Kanta Tuneyama 10-21, 21-15, 21-18 in the first meeting between the two.READ?|?US Open Badminton: Parupalli Kashyap, HS Prannoy enter quartersThe World No.23 will next take on Vietnamese veteran and 15th seed Tien Minh Nguyen, who has a 1-0 record against the Indian.When you defeat the #CanadaGP champion and advance into the semifinals of #USAGPG.

Vigilance Commissioner T M Bhasin told PTI the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given the necessary approval to the CVC on this. The move comes after the Supreme Court last year ruled that the chairman, managing directors and other officers of a private bank could be seen as public servants when it came to the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, 1988. The anti-corruption watchdog is the statutory body which probes cases of graft involving central government departments, public sector organisations (including banks and insurance companies) and their employees. \"The CVC can now also look into cases of corruption involving private sector banks and their managements like CMDs and MDs,\" Bhasin said. He said the RBI and the Department of Financial Services had recently approved the provisions in this regard. \"The necessary mechanism has been put in place and cases of corruption in the private sector banks are now being looked into,\" Bhasin said. The apex court had said all officials working in banks operating under an RBI licence would be defined as public servants under the PC Act.

He also had heard of the flamboyant batsman in the domestic circuit in Delhi and knew immediately that a special talent was in the making. Sehwag knows the India captain in and out and now has some interesting tales to tell about Kohli.Until Kohli became the captain of the Indian Test team, he was infamous for his brash and aggressive attitude and had quite a few run-ins with opposition players on the field. Coming from Delhi, the aggression and extreme passion for the game came naturally to him which reflected in his game as well.Sehwag though, was quite the opposite even though he hails from the same state. The Nawab of Najafgarh was always seen as a jovial character who used to sing songs while batting and made light work of the high-class bowling that he faced during his illustrious career. Even now in his career as a broadcaster, Sehwag is hilarious with his commentary and doesn\\'t like to mince his words.Sehwag, in a recent show with Star Sports, narrated a particular story about Kohli where he revealed how he used to behave like a shy youngster in front of the seniors but was the complete opposite during his U-19 days.\"He was a shy and quite youngster in front of us senior players but when he was in the U-19 team he used to be very very naughty. I\\'ve heard a lot of stories about how naughty he was him from his U-19 coach Ajit Chaudhary.\"Once Chaudhary told me that Kohli fell ill or was play acting so his coach told him that he wouldn\\'t play in the next match. And suddenly Kohli\\'s fever went away and he became absolutely fine after hearing that, started batting normally the way he does in the nets also. He played the next match and smashed a double hundred,\" Sehwag told Star Sports in an interview.Sehwag also recalled the time he heard about Kohli for the first time and what he thought of the future India captain the first time he saw him bat live.', 'The Delhi government on Tuesday asked for sufficient time to sensitise people about the Odd-even scheme before reintroducing it while proposing a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) with the Union government to oversee cleaning of the Yamuna.

So, a swift search on online marketplaces such as OLX shows that hundreds of cows are up for sale in the virtual world.The environment ministry decreed last week that animal markets could only trade cattle for agricultural purposes, such as ploughing and dairy production. The rule came as part of a tough new law against animal cruelty, but critics say they are aimed at placating hardline Hindu supporters of the Narendra Modi government. The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday suspended the order for four weeks.Ravi Sharma from Uttar Pradesh\\'s holy city Varanasi, which Prime Minister Modi represents in Parliament, seemed a little wary when spoken to about his online post selling a desi brown cow for Rs 75,000. He first wanted to know what this correspondent intended to do with it and what community she belonged to, categorically stating that he has no interest in selling to a certain minority group.Not far away from Varanasi, in Ghazipur, Bheem Singh is keen to get rid of three cows at the earliest. So much so that he is open to a distress sale for as much as 50 per cent less than the market price for cows. \"It\\'s too dangerous keeping cows any more. Anyone can come and beat us,\" he said while pushing this correspondent to close the deal over the phone.The past two years have seen a rise in vigilante attacks on Muslims and lower caste Hindus involved in the cattle trade, leading to several deaths. A group of alleged \"cow protectors\" thrashed two meat traders on the suspicion that they were carrying beef on May 26. Police in Rajasthan\\'s Bhilwara arrested five people, including an alleged member of the RSS - the BJP\\'s ideological mentor - who torched a truck last week that they thought was carrying cows for slaughter.Several state governments have appealed to the PM to repeal the order, which they say was issued without consultations with them. Some have decided to drag the Centre to court. Environment minister Harsh Vardhan had said that cattle bought and sold directly from farms would not be affected by the government\\'s order. \"The aim of the rules is only to regulate the animal market and sale of cattle in them and ensure (the) welfare of cattle\" in the markets,\" he had said. But many commentators see the move as a blow to beef and leather exports that will leave hundreds of thousands jobless and deprive millions of Christians, Muslims and poor Hindus of a cheap source of protein.It\\'s not that cows have not been sold on e-commerce websites before. They have been available occasionally under the pets section.

The incident happened on February 16 when the Mumbai- London flight 9W-118, carrying 330 passengers and 15 crew members, lost contact with the Air Traffic Control (ATC) reportedly for almost 33 minutes. \"It was a training flight for the pilot on the commanders seat when it lost contact with the ATC due to frequency goof- up. Though, the Czech aviation authorities tried contacting the pilot of the flight 9W-118 on emergency frequency, the pilot missed it due to howling noise,\" airline sources said. A response from Jet Airways on the issue was awaited. According to information, the flight remained out of touch of ATC for nearly 33 minutes when it was flying over Czech airspace. While flying from Bratislava to Prague, 9W-118 was on correct frequency (132.890MHz) as it transmitted and acknowledged the messages.

However, it wasn?t an easy start for her, considering she had to face some bizarre criticism in the aspiring actor phase.?There were some low phases in my life; there were films offered by big banners, but they were not the best debut projects. So, I had to tell myself that I should be patient and good things will happen to me,? says Kriti, who was born and brought up in Delhi and shifted to Mumbai to try her luck in Bollywood.The actor, who turned 27 on Thursday, adds, ?There were days when I was annoyed and irritated. On some days, I used to cry, because there was nothing to keep me busy. There were also times when I met a few people who told me that something was not right about me ? someone told me, ?You?re too good-looking. There has to be some sort of imperfection in you to look real on screen.? I think I did feel low, but at the same time, I did have people who believed in me a lot. That?s what you need.

However, the state police chief claims, the new teams will comprise a polite, observant and trained set of personnel who will act as a deterrent only to eve-teasers and stalkers.A pre-poll promise of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the drive was aimed at punishing molesters and harassers in public places. However, vigilante groups took over the exercise, often targeting young couples and handing out embarrassing punishments.\"Earlier, these squads were not trained. They were often over-enthusiastic and took foolish actions like chasing young people and grilling them,\" said state DGP Sulkhan Singh in an exclusive interview to Mail Today. \"This brought bad name to a well-meaning exercise.\"According to Singh, the new teams underwent a curriculum designed by the Women Power Line, a unit for prevention and detection of crime against women, with three areas of focus: behavioural, legal and practical.\"They only have to be vigilant and observant about situations and see if a man or a group of men are harassing women. They are being taught that. Training is over in 30 of the 75 districts,\" said the IPS officer who was DG (training) before being elevated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath.\\'NO MURGA PUNISHMENTS\\' The top cop assured that there will be no more arrests, shaving of heads, blackening of faces or murga punishments (a stress position of holding ears) or chasing of couples at public parks, college campuses, railway stations and shopping malls in the name of curbing eve-teasing or protecting women.Singh said the squad will also be asked to use body cameras to protect themselves from charges of human rights violations or other wild allegations. These teams will not be given the power to investigate but only detain the stalkers, rowdy elements and issue warnings after \"careful observation of a situation\".The curriculum also conducted sensitisation classes of policemen where they were taught to how to behave with young couples and spot a suspicious character.\"The squad is being given training in distinguishing a molester from a friend through keen observation and by being vigilant. Earlier these squads were trained only as a police officer. They will see a group of boys and they will go and threaten them... a girl and boy will be walking together and they will question them. These things should not happen,\" the DGP said.Supporting the need for such a squad, Singh said it was necessary to prevent teasing, molestation or harassment of women at public place and instill a sense of security among people.The Allahabad high court in March had upheld Yogi Adityanath government\\'s move to set up these squads but cautioned that the police must act only as per law and not \"outside its purview\". The move invited criticism from several quarters following allegations that the police were invading private space of citizens. The opposition even sought Central intervention into what they alleged \"violation of the Constitution\" by allowing anti-Romeo squads to \"ridicule democracy and the freedom of youngsters\".\\'IMPARTIAL POLICE\\'Singh said the biggest achievement of the Yogi government on the law and order front was its \"impartial policing\". \"Now people can say that similar action is being taken in similar cases and there is no distinction on the basis of his or her political affiliation or status. Whoever breaks the law will be dealt with an iron fist,\" the DGP said.Without naming any party or organisation, Singh said the police are not hesitating to take strong action against the \"newly emboldened constituents for their over-enthusiasm\" and cited strict action against cow vigilantes and the dealing of Saharanpur riots.Contrary to the view of opposition parties who referred to several incidents of rape, caste violence and \\'gau rakshaks\\' as worsening law and order situation in the state, Singh said the situation had \"in fact improved\".\"After stern action was taken against cow vigilantes who indulged in violence in the name of cow protection, such incidents are no longer taking place in UP now,\" the DGP said.Regarding the Saharanpur riots, where Thakurs and Dalits were locked in violent clashes and tension persisted for weeks, Singh said: \"Some people tried to create a volatile situation but police took prompt action. Now Saharanpur is quiet. We will deal each case according to its merit without yielding to any political or social affiliation. There are people who tried to escalate the situation by committing crimes. They could not.\"The DGP said he would not like to join issues with politicians and kept his role to policing alone. \"There are two aspects to policing-crime and public order. Public order is the order in public places. Incidents of mobs having a field day, rioting, damaging public property etc. have come down drastically. If anyone indulges in it, strict action will be taken.\"On the transfer of Shreshta Thakur, a woman police officer of Bulandshahar who stood up against local BJP leaders and sent five of them to jail for creating obstacles in discharging government duties, the DGP said it was a routine transfer along with many others. \"There was no pressure at all from the government side.

But when it comes to basic civic amenities, the village has nothing to show.  The village, with a population of about 800, is battling broken roads, inconsistent water supply and choked drains. Saurav Verma, 18, a student of Delhi University and resident of Kadipur village, has to wake up at 5 in the morning every alternate day, and wait an hour till the water tank is filled up. Verma, and most other residents of the village, say while the WiFi facility may have waited, the government should have first ensured regular water supply, an approach road and improved connectivity.Kadipur was declared a ?free Wi-Fi? village on June 19 by the local councillor Urmila Rana. Villagers access the facility by registering their phone numbers on which they get security code to log in.Delhi BJP chief and Northeast Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari had adopted Kadipur village under the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojna in 2014.A month after the WiFi facility was launched, Hindustan Times visited the village and found that while the internet facility was working fine, most villagers were disappointed with the civic infrastructure.?We get only two hours of water supply that too every alternate day. It would have been better if the government would fixed this instead of spending on improving internet connectivity,? Verma said.It takes Verma at least two hours to reach Delhi University (North Campus) as connectivity to different parts of the city from the village is poor. The villagers have to hail shared vans to reach the main road 5 km away from where they get transport.  Though the internal roads were fine, the approach roads to the village are dust bowls with waterlogging at some places.Another resident, who did not wish to be identified, said, ?There are times when we could not sleep whole night because there are warehouses here where movement of trucks continue entire night. We complained to the local councillor but nothing happened. The politicians focus on populist measures while the basic infrastructure is crumbling.?He said that the drains are clogged and water overflows at several places.?The mobile connectivity is not a big issue. Children in the village anyway had mobile phones with internet facility. We are not dependent on government for WiFi,? he said.Anil Kashyap, another resident, said things have improved a bit.  ?There has been some development in the past few years. He said earlier the villagers have to wait five days for getting water supply.?He said improved connectivity will create better employment opportunities for the village youth, he said.Area councillor Urmila Rana said she has written to the Delhi government several times for improving the water supply but nothing has happened. ?I would have got the roads constructed but the corporation is yet to notify the newly drawn municipal zones because of which no development funds could be allocated.?Manoj Tiwari told Hindustan Times that it was for the Delhi government to take care of problems related to water and power. ?I have adopted the village and my funds will be used for the purpose.

The police, however, refuted the claim and said the engineer died in a suspected case of rash driving. According to the BSES spokesperson, three discom teams raided Jhul Jhuli village in Jaffarpur Kalan this afternoon following a tip-off about large-scale power theft in the area. The teams, accompanied by Delhi Police, came under attack and had to retreat, he said. \"The teams were chased by bike-borne goons. In the ensuing melee, one of the cars rammed a tree. Assistant engineer Abhimanyu Singh (32) was grievously injured. He later died,\" he said. A senior police officer said the BSES teams were provided adequate police force for the raid which went \"successfully\". \"Twenty six police personnel were accompanying the BSES teams. The anti power theft drive was successful. \"One of the cars met with an accident. No one was being chased as per initial reports,\" said the officer. A case has been registered in the matter, he said, adding the four injured BSES team members have been admitted to a hospital. In June this year, a Delhi Police sub-inspector and three BSES employees were injured in stone-pelting by locals during an anti-power theft drive in outer Delhi\\'s Ranhola area. ISOLATED INCIDENTS \"These are not isolated incidents. Efforts of discom teams to check irregularities are often thwarted by law- defying people who function like organised gangs. Power theft has taken shape of an organised crime and active police support is needed to curb this menace,\" said the BSES spokesperson. Despite intensive efforts to reduce power theft, Jaffarpur continues to incur 60 per cent losses, he said. In the last five years, around 14,000 cases of power theft, having a connected load of around 33,000 KW, have been unearthed in the area, the spokesman added.

However, Britain, which colonised India for 200 years, is yet to tender an apology for the incident and similar such excesses committed by its forces on the native people.While Canada has apologised for the 1914 Komagata Maru incident and Japan has said sorry to South Korea over the Korean women forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during the World War II, the UK has yet to express any such sentiments.The Jallianwala Bagh massacre had taken place in Amritsar on April 13, 1919. On hearing that a meeting of nearly 20,000 people was taking place at Jallianwala Bagh, Brigadier General REH Dyer had ordered 50 riflemen to shoot at the crowd.More than 1,000 innocent Indians were killed and over 1,100 injured. Though Britain has described the incident as \"shameful\", it has fallen far short of tendering an apology.In 2013, former British Prime Minister David Cameron described the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as a \"deeply shameful event\". But he did not apologise for it.MERE LIP SERVICE, NO APOLOGY YET FROM BRITAINEarlier, during their ceremonial visit to Jallianwala Bagh in 1997, Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh merely signed on the visitor\\'s book. They did not leave any comment, leave aside, even regretting the incident.Congress MP and author Shashi Tharoor is of the view that the Jallianwala Bagh centenary in 2019 would be a \"good time\" for the UK to apologise to Indians for the excesses committed during their 200-odd rule.While speaking on his book \\'An Era of Darkness: The British Empire In India\\' before inaugurating the Kolkata Literary Festival-2017, had said, \"Either the British Prime Minister or a member of the royal family can come and convey their own profound apologies to the people of India, not just for that atrocity (Jallianwala Bagh massacre) but for all wrongs done during the empire.\"Tharoor pointed out that one cannot quantify the wrongs done by the Britishers. He is of the opinion that an apology would be far more important than any financial compensation.CANADA APOLOGISED FOR 1914 KOMAGATA MARU INCIDENTWhile it is still uncertain whether the Britishers would act contrite for the excesses committed by them, Canada apologised for the 1914 Komagata Maru incident where hundreds of Hindu, Sikh and Muslim immigrants were denied entry into that country and turned away from the port of Vancouver to return to an uncertain and ultimately violent fate in India.In May 2016, almost 102 years after Canada turned away over 376 migrants, mostly Sikhs from India, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formally apologised in Parliament for the \"great injustice\" that had happened due to discriminatory laws of the time.Trudeau apologised in the House of Commonsfor the 1914 decision by the then Canadian government to turn away the migrants onboard the ship Komagata Maru after their arrival in Vancouver.Komagata Maru sailed into Vancouver harbour on May 23, 1914 from Hong Kong, but most of the passengers were eventually turned away on the grounds of the \"continuous journey clause\" that allowed only travellers on a trip without interruption to land in Canada.After two months in limbo in the harbour, the ship was escorted out of the harbour by the military. It returned to India and on its arrival, at least 19 people were killed in a skirmish with British soldiers, while others were jailed.JAPAN\\'S APOLOGY TO SOUTH KOREA FOR COMFORT WOMENIn December 2015, Japan apologised to South Korea for having forced the latter\\'s women into sexual slavery during the World War II. The Korean women had been enslaved by Japan for its soldiers.Japan had colonised Korea from 1910-45.The sensitive issue had remained a sore point in relations between the two East Asian countries for decades before they reached a landmark deal. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe issued a statement to apologise and express remorse \"from the heart for all the people suffering hard-to-cure wounds and many pains\" physically and psychologically.He had said in the comfort women issue, many women under the then military\\'s involvement bore deep scars to their honour and dignity. From this perspective, his statement said, the Japanese government acutely feels responsible.Besides expressing its regret, contrition and apology for its colonial-era sexual enslavement of Korean women, Japan also agreed to provide 1 billion yen ($8.3 million) for a foundation to be established by South Korea to support the surviving victims.WILLY BRANDT APOLOGY FOR NAZI CRIMESIn December 1970, German social democrat leader Willy Brandt went on his knees in front of the monument to the Jews who had rebelled in the Warsaw Ghetto.Though he was in no way related to the crimes of the Nazis, Brandt apologised on their behalf during a visit to Poland.Shashi Tharoor and the likes of him would only hope that the UK takes a cue from Canada, Japan and Germany to apologise to India for the inhuman treatment of the native people during their rule.

Police said the girls admitted they knew about the prank video but claimed that Sumit and Kadyan had not told them the video would later be uploaded on YouTube for money.Senior crime branch officials said they were taking legal advice to act against Sumit and Kadyan. ?Sumit and Kadyan had told us the girls were their friends and the video was made with their consent. They had also claimed the girls knew it was a prank video which will be later uploaded on YouTube,? said a senior officer.?But now the statements of the girls contradict the claims made by the two men, we want to question them again.

After the Rajasthan High Court struck down the move to bring five castes, including Gujjars, under the Special Backward Castes (SBC) category, the Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakashan Sangharsh Samiti has begun to demand that a separate reservation of 5 per cent be created for the nomadic castes within the Other Backward Classes (OBC), thus abiding with the total cap of 50 per cent on reservation. This, the agitating Gujjars feel, can help avoid the court\\'s scrutiny.The Rajasthan government had, through a Bill in September, 2015, provided 5 per cent reservation for 5 castes under the Special Backward Classes (SBC), thus taking the total reservation in Rajasthan to 54 per cent. These castes include Gujjars, Banjaras, Gadia Lohars, Gadarias and Raikas.RAJASTHAN GOVERNMENT IN DILEMMA OVER DEMANDThe Rajasthan government is presently in a dilemma about whether it must accept the demand. If it yields, it runs the risk of antagonising other castes whose share in the reservation quota will then drop. Such castes include the Jats and Bishnois, among many others.Currently, according to the Supreme Court, the cap on reservation under different categories in government jobs is 50 per cent. Before the government decided to bring in a Bill for 5 per cent reservation in September last year, caste-based reservation in government jobs in Rajasthan stood at 49 per cent. That included 21 per cent for OBCs, 16 per cent for Scheduled Castes and 12 per cent for Scheduled Tribes.Also read | Raj Govt tries to assure Gujjars on quota after stir threatThe High Court had mentioned that five castes (Gujjars, Banjaras, Gadarias, Raikas and Gadia Lohars), previously falling in the category of OBCs and getting benefits of reservation, have been brought under SBCs to provide five per cent reservation, exceeding the ceiling of 50 per cent. The court observed that the SBC Commission and the state government had failed to discharge their obligation, as per the directions of the apex court, to collect quantifiable data. The court, citing the Supreme Court\\'s 9-judge bench Indira Sahani judgement, stated that there were no special reasons for creating a separate 5 per cent reservation pool for these castes. The court mentioned that according to a report, there were 25 more backward castes.GUJJARS FEEL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT KEPT PROMISEThe representative Gujjars, who have witnessed several violent agitations in the past, feel that the government has so far not fulfilled its promise of ensuring Amendment to the 9th Schedule to bring in the requisite changes. In May 2015, members of the Gujjar community began agitating in Bharatpur by once again blocking railway tracks. After that, representatives of the Sangharsh Samiti were called in for a dialogue. As per Himmat Singh Gujjar, spokesperson for Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (RGASS), the government during the dialogue that happened following the May agitation had promised that changes would be made in the 9th Schedule of the Constitution at the Central level, thus fulfilling the government\\'s promise on the issue of reservation.

The script of the current unrest seems similar to last year\\'s Jawaharlal Nehru University controversy when a group of students was alleged to have raised anti-national slogans. However, JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar raised no anti-India slogans for which he was charged with sedition last year, top officials investigating the case have revealed to India Today, citing forensic examination of voice samples. Â\\xa0Controversial slogans resonated through the JNU campus in February, 2016, sparking a national debate on freedom of expression and nationalism.Bhim Sen Bassi was commissioner of the Delhi police when several students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, including Kumar, were charged with sedition for alleged anti-India cries.POLICE YET TO FILE CASEBut an India Today investigation has found police have yet to file a formal chargesheet in the case that involved charges as serious as sedition. Bassi and his successor Alok Verma have, in the meantime, moved on from the city\\'s police force.A senior special-cell officer, requesting anonymity, said, \"We are trying to connect the lose ends and are in the process of filing a chargesheet.\" The officer added that it would be incorrect to say there is no evidence against accused in the case.Top sources in the Delhi police\\'s special cell, which is investigating the matter, have revealed they sent as many as 40 video samples of the controversial JNU event for forensic examinationMost of the footage, they said, have been found to be authentic.Also read: If Afzal Guru is terrorist, so is Godse: Kanhaiya KumarUMAR KHALID MAY HAVE RAISED ANTI-INDIA CRIESAnti-India sloganeering did ring through the JNU campus that day, but Kumar\\'s voice has tested negative in the forensic tests, highly-placed special-cell sources revealed.Kumar, the investigators said, had reached the scene after a clash broke out between JNU students and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad activists.But lab examinations have identified nine students as possible slogan-shouters, including Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, special-cell sources said.Most of the other slogan shouters were Kashmiri students from several universities, Jamia Millia Islamia and the Aligarh Muslim University included, according to special-cell officials.But no FIR has since been lodged against the Kashmiri suspects, they said.Also read: Ramjas violence: Campus politics turning colleges into battlegrounds, hurting academic freedom?KANHAIYA: HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED MY INNOCENCEIndia Today spoke to Kanhaiya Kumar, who said he has not seen this report, but added that he has always maintained that he has been wrongly implicated. \"I was always sure that truth will come out... and conspiracy against JNU will also revealed,\" he said.

Ramachandran has told Reuters.Ramachandran said the IOA also wanted India to host the Asian Beach Games in 2020, the Olympic Council of Asia\\'s general assembly that year, and the International Olympic Committee session in 2021.The aim, Ramachandran said, was to use the engagement as a catalyst for the growth of Olympic sports in India and to help improve the country\\'s miserable standing in pretty much every sport apart from cricket.As the world\\'s second-most populous nation after China, Ramachandran said it was time for India to follow its powerful neighbour in showcasing its burgeoning economic muscle through sport.Dismissing concerns about whether India can afford to stage such huge sporting spectacles, Ramachandran said the country was one of the few in the region that did have the means.It was up to the government to set the wheels in motion, he told Reuters in an interview.\"From my part, I am telling them if you bid, I will make sure you get it,\" he added.Ramachandran said he had spoken about India\\'s prospects of hosting an Olympics with IOC President Thomas Bach, an indication of the early groundwork required for a serious bid.\"You cannot take a decision today and say, \\'I want to host an Olympic Games tomorrow.\\' It is an eight-year process. So you have to start now,\" Ramachandran said.\"If you are looking at anything it\\'s 2032. That will give you 10 years to improve the infrastructure and you will have a decision (to make) in the next four to six years.\"The Indian government had agreed to discuss the proposals in cabinet and revert back to the IOA, Ramachandran added.ECONOMIC POWERWinning the hosting rights for an Olympic Games is not the hot ticket it once was.Los Angeles and Paris are the only candidates left in the race for the 2024 Olympics after four other cities pulled out over cost concerns. The IOC will award both the 2024 and 2028 Summer Games at the same time and the expectation is that the two cities will host one each.For the 2022 Winter Games, four of six bidders pulled out citing high costs or lack of support, leaving Beijing to beat Almaty in the final vote.Ramachandran was confident India, which has Asia\\'s third-largest economy, would be capable of meeting the costs.\"India is one of the emerging economies,\" he said. \"Even assuming you spend $12 billion on an Olympic event, $6 billion will be given to you by the IOC.\"What is $6 billion over a period of eight years for a country which has the size of the economy which India has today?\"Not many countries today wish to host the Olympics. China has already had everything possible that can be hosted.\"In terms of hosting experience, India has successfully staged several global cricket tournaments, and FIFA say they are satisfied with preparations for the Under-17 World Cup in October.But a question mark over the country\\'s ability to host an international multi-sports event has hung over India since the 2010 Commonwealth Games, a $6 billion event billed as Delhi\\'s answer to the Beijing Olympics.LEARNED FROM MISTAKESA series of embarrassments over leaking stadiums and filthy accommodation culminated in Games chief Suresh Kalmadi spending nine months in prison for inflating tenders worth millions of dollars.Ramachandran said there would be no repeat of those blunders.\"We have learnt from our mistakes. You see the South Asian Games (in 2016) that was hosted in Guwahati. Nobody said anything,\" he added.\"We should stick to what we know best - technical conduct of the Games. Even when we hosted the Commonwealth Games in India, (the IOC) praised the technical conduct of the event. And we also did very well in the medals tally.\"While the hosts finished second to Australia at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, to say that India has underperformed at the Olympics is an understatement.India has won just 28 medals since 1900, with Abhinav Bindra claiming the country\\'s only individual gold medal in the men\\'s 10 metre air rifle in Beijing.', \"Sony TV is in a crisis of sorts after its flagship show The Kapil Sharma Show witnessed a huge drop in TRPs, after four of its cast members quit following a mid-air tiff with host Kapil.

Aged 55, he had been working on a report examining Russia?s role in the conflict in Ukraine. His killing sent a chill through opposition circles.The same court last month found the five men guilty of killing Nemtsov, but the late politician?s allies said the investigation had been a cover-up and that the people who had ordered his killing remained at large.The court handed the longest sentence, of 20 years, to Zaur Dadayev, a former soldier in Chechnya and the man state prosecutors said pulled the trigger. The other four Chechen men convicted of being his accomplices received jail sentences ranging from 11 to 19 years.?The shortcoming of this sentencing is that those who ordered and organised this crime are not in the dock,? said Vadim Prokhorov, a lawyer for Nemtsov?s daughter Zhanna.State prosecutors said the group had followed Nemtsov around the Russian capital and had been promised a bounty of 15 million roubles ($249,169.44) between them for the high-profile assassination.Shamsudin Tsakayev, Dadayev?s lawyer, told Reuters after the sentencing that there was ?incontrovertible proof? that his client had not committed the crime.', \"Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan coming together in Kabir Khan's Tubelight is probably the biggest news of the year.

Sources said the panel of doctors that had conducted his postmortem said it appeared to be a a case of murder and not suicide after which a case was registered. Ganeshan was doing his MD degree at AIIMS at that time.The report said the cannula through which the medicine was injected was fixed in the right forearm and as Ganeshan was right handed, it wouldn?t have been possible for him to do it himself. ?Doctors said he could not have possibly placed the cannula on the spot on which it was found. They said it appears someone injected the medicine forcefully,? a police source said.Sources said the bottle of medicine, suspected to be potassium chloride, was not found at the spot. ?If he injected on his own, then the bottle should have been on the spot. No such bottle was recovered by the investigative team. Also, the door of the flat was ajar and no suicide note was found at his flat. All this indicates that it may be a case of murder,? a police source said.Police said Ganeshan?s father had also moved a writ petition in the high court, pleading that the case be handed over to crime branch for investigation. The police said earlier they suspected it to be a case of suicide as there were no visible abrasions on his body.?Ganeshan?s father said he suspects murder.

(Kohli\\'s friendship comment made in heat of moment: Warne)\"Against Australia, probably he (Kohli) was so consumed by wanting to win as captain that he let his emotions affect his batting.

The contest was marred by one controversy after another with the two captains -- Kohli and Steve Smith -- continuously being in the eye of a storm.Kohli was in sublime form before this series, becoming the only man to slam double hundreds in four consecutive series. The 28-year-old amassed 1457 runs in 13 matches this season. But he had a horrendous outing with the bat in the series against Tests against Australia, totalling just 46 runs in five innings with scores of 0, 13, 12, 15 and 6 in three games. He had to sit out of the fourth and final Test because of a shoulder injury. Ganguly, regarded as one of India\\'s most successful captains, rated Kohli as among of the finest in the world while describing him as a passionate skipper.\"There are two Virats for me. The batsman and the captain. (Kohli has ensured India will never back down: Clarke to India Today)\"The batsman surely is one of the best in the world because he has set high standards for himself, both in terms of fitness and the hunger to score big.

I remember when he was dropped for a Test in West Indies last year, I had said Pujara was a special batsman and shouldn\\'t have been dropped. A small matter of 1,316 runs have come from his bat this season and Pujara will be the most critical for Virat when India start travelling outside of the sub-continent.\"\\'POTENTIAL TO WIN ANYWHERE\\'Ganguly said the current Indian team has the potential to win anywhere in the world.\"And having watched the last 13 home Tests, I hope Virat and his team really has the potential to win anywhere - in or outside India,\" he said.Talking about the Dharamsala Test, which according to him was the highlight of the season, Ganguly wrote: \"I was sitting at home around lunchtime on Day Three when Australia began its second innings. (Virat Kohli needs to take short break from cricket: Brad Haddin )\"Over the next hour or so, I watched such a great piece of fast and hostile bowling by the two Indians, Umesh Yadav and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. The way they got the Australians hopping and succumbing to the pace, I am so pleased for Virat.\"The most memorable win came in conditions actually tailor-made for the Australians more than the Indians.

', 'It?s been over a fortnight since the goods and services tax regime kicked in. But about 85,000 registered traders in the Capital are still to migrate to the new regime, sources in Delhi government?s trade and taxes department said .According to a government estimate, about 4.15 lakh traders were registered with the tax department under the previous value-added tax (VAT) regime. Around 3.3 lakh traders are said to have migrated to GST till last week. Sources in the department said while many traders have not been able to migrate due to ?mismatch? in the permanent account number (PAN) provided by the traders, others have still not turned up for registration.?Any registered trader continuing with business without completing the formalities will technically be illegal,? a senior tax department official said. H Rajesh Prasad, commissioner, trade and taxes department, however, said while the number of traders who have not been able to migrate due to the PAN mismatch is not much. ?The number of such traders would not be more than a few thousand. One major reason for the PAN mismatch is change in proprietorship over generations or partnership firms changing hands. The old registration must have details of the older proprietor,? said Prasad, who has been closely associated in the GST implementation.?However, such traders are being advised to apply afresh and get a new application reference number and continue with trade,? Prasad said.Officials said while the department is making efforts to ensure all eligible traders are enrolled under the GST, the number of overall registered traders is likely to be corrected due to several reasons. ?Many of registered traders might have stopped business altogether. There is also a possibility other few accounts are either dormant or are no more eligible for the registration owning to the annual turnover cap,? an official said.All traders with an annual turnover of R 20 lakh have to register with the trade and taxes department. In order to assist the traders in GST implementation, the Delhi government has decided to run six ?GST help vans? in commercial areas to address traders? problems arising out of the new tax regime. The government has also decided to set up help desks in smaller markets. The decision was taken after deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds the finance portfolio, held a meeting with senior officers of the trade and taxes department on the implementation of the GST last week. The government has already put in place GST facilitation centres. ', 'New Delhi, Apr 30 (PTI) A young Ramdev was so moved by the writings of Dayanand Saraswati that he quit the government school as the curriculum was a leftover of the colonial education policy, fled from home and enrolled himself in a gurukul. Saraswatis book \"Satyarth Prakash\" had a deep impact on Ramdev. While greeting someone over phone, Ramdev never says hello. Instead he chants Om. The first chapter of \"Satyarth Prakash\" explains the etymology and significance of Om. After reading the book, Ramdev wanted to follow the path shown by the ancient sages. As the path of ancient sages also meant practice of celibacy, so he took a vow - to never marry. A new book \"The Baba Ramdev Phenomenon: From Moksha to Market\" by Kaushik Deka has these nuggets of information. \"Satyarth Prakash\" was written in Hindi in 1875 by the renowned religious and social reformer and the founder of Arya Samaj. The book formed the intellectual core and social, political and economic philosophy of the yoga guru. It was a book primarily explaining the true tenets of Hinduism, making an appeal for one uniform religion based on the principles of the Vedas. \"This book was a revelation to me. It awakened my inner- self, gave me a sense of purpose in life. It introduced me to the wisdom of our ancestors. I wanted to follow the path shown by the ancient sages,\" Ramdev is quoted as saying. \"Satyarth Prakash\" not only changed Ramdevs life but also gave it a direction and purpose. \"He was so moved by the writings of Dayanand Saraswati that he quit the government school where the curriculum was a leftover of the education policy introduced by British politician Babington Macaulay (1800?59), who was instrumental in the introduction of English as the medium of instruction for higher education in India. \"He knew his parents would never agree to his decision of quitting regular school, where he was doing exceptionally well. So one fine day he fled from home and enrolled himself in a gurukul, a traditional educational institute based on Vedic principles, at Khanpur in Haryana,\" Deka writes. Ramdev was the brightest student in the government primary school, located in the village, where he studied till the class V. For higher classes he moved to the Shahbajpur High School, a few kilometres away. \"I used to buy second-hand books, yet I always topped my class,\" claims Ramdev. \"Dayanandji made me realise the value of the treasure trove hidden in Vedic education. Its a progressive approach based on tark (logic), tathya (facts), yukti (argument) and praman (evidence). The goal of British education system was to enslave our mind and curb free and logical thinking,\" he says. \"The Baba Ramdev Phenomenon: From Moksha to Market\", published by Rupa, offers a detailed account of Ramdevs journey from attaining moksha in the Himalayas to ruling the market, especially the FMCG sector, with his Patanjali products. It captures the rise and rise of Patanjali and the various factors that worked for it, most importantly, the vision of Ramdev and the assistance of his associate Acharya Balkrishna. ', 'Besides four Bharatiya Janata Party legislators, there were two more in the 70-member Delhi Vidhan Sabha who voted for Ramnath Kovind, the NDA-backed presidential candidate who emerged the winner  on Thursday.The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)?suspects the two MLAs who cross voted could be among  the five suspended party legislators. Former water minister Kapil Mishra, who was suspended from the party in March for making corruption allegations against Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, told Hindustan Times that he voted for the ?winning candidate?. ?It is obvious that one would vote for the winning candidate. I am glad that my vote got counted in the final result,? Mishra said on Thursday.  Ahead of the polls, the AAP had announced its support to the opposition?s candidate Meira Kumar. Of the total 69 MLAs of Delhi, 67 -- 63 AAP, 4 BJP -- voted in the presidential polls on Monday. AAP had 67 MLAs initially. However, its strength reduced to 65?after one of its MLA,?Ved Prakash from Bawana joined the BJP?in March just before the municipal elections. The AAP lost the Rajouri Garden seat to BJP?s Manjinder Singh in the byelection.    Despite the four votes from the BJP that went to Kovind, the former governor of Bihar who won with a landslide victory in the Presidential elections on Thursday, got a total of six votes --- which means that two AAP MLAs had cross-voted. Opposition?s candidate Meira Kumar, on the other hand, got 55 votes. Six votes were found invalid. The AAP, however, reacted to the voting pattern on positively and blamed the suspended MLAs for cross-voting. ?While we know for sure Kapil Mishra voted for Kovind, the other one must be some suspended MLA only,? said Saurabh Bhardwaj, AAP spokesperson and MLA from Greater Kailash. Bhardwaj was among the two MLAs who did not vote in the elections as he was out of town. Another MLA Devinder Sehrawat had stayed away from voting. ?It is in fact a proud moment for us that despite there being no whip, our MLAs voluntarily supported Ms Kumar and opposed those who propagate fundamentalism,? Bhardwaj said.Leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly Vijender Gupta said the election result indicates that dissent is simmering in AAP. ?Arvind Kejriwal is unable to keep his flock intact. He had to change his stand. In the beginning, the party had earlier announced to support Meira Kumar but Kejriwal later urged his legislators to vote according to their ?conscience?. What does it mean? He was sure that AAP MLAs could cross-vote. This shows clear insecurity in their leadership,? said the BJP leader.Gupta further added that victory of Kovind is a victory of India?s flourishing democracy. ?His victory has further strengthened our democratic system. I am confident under Kovind?s presidentship, the nation will march on road to progress with greater confidence and faith,? he said.

Also read: Terror angle in Kanpur train tragedy: NIA, IB on hunt for recruiter in derailment casesKANPUR TRAIN TRAGEDYThe NIA has sought cooperation from the Nepal police in connection with the interrogation of Shamul Hoda, a suspected ISI operative arrested in Dubai and deported to Nepal late last week. Hoda is suspected to be the mastermind of an ISI plot to derail trains and cause massive loss of life in India. The Bihar police initially busted three people - Motilal Paswan, Umashankar Patel and Mukesh Yadav for reportedly planting explosives on the rail track in east Champaran. Fortunately the explosives were detected and a tragedy averted. On sustained interrogation the three confessed to having allegedly been paid by Brij Kishore Giri, their handler in Nepal who in turn had been paid by Shafi Sheikh and Shamsul Hoda. According to officials in the Bihar police, the three had been paid Rs 3 lakh each for planting the explosives. Simultaneous investigations by the Nepal police revealed that Arun and Deepak Ram were killed on Hoda\\'s instructions for refusing to blast rail tracks and kill people. \"Apparently Hoda did not want to leave any trail. Since both Arun and Deepak Ram knew of the plot and refused to carry it out, they were eliminated,\" sources said.Â\\xa0Investigators painstakingly tracked down Hoda in Dubai and intelligence officials kept an eye on his movement and phone conversations. In one conversation Hoda spelt out the plan to derail trains and kill people, the intelligence officials passed on the audio link to their counterparts in the middle-east. \"Hoda was deported to Nepal where the police arrested him for the murder of Arun and Deepak Ram. He is currently being questioned and may be brought face to face with the other suspects in the case to unravel the entire plot,\" sources added.Â\\xa0A team of NIA sleuths is also travelling to Nepal to question Hoda in connection with the Kanpur and Koneru derailments.

Auctioneers Bonhams presented nearly 400 lots, including many that were used on the surface of the moon. The auction coincided with the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch, with over 50 items from that mission on sale. These included the star chart used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to determine their position on the lunar surface, which went for $218,000. The chart comprises two rotating plastic discs 9 inches across, and a velcro patch on the back containing traces of lunar dust.In a letter accompanying the chart, Aldrin called it \"the single most critical navigational device we used while on the moon.\"Other high-ticket items were the flight joystick from Falcon ? the lunar module of Apollo 15 ? and a mission checklist that lunar explorers on Apollo 16 attached to their wrist. The checklist was intended to guide astronauts John Young and Charles Duke through their mission on the lunar surface, but Nasa engineers couldn\\'t help inserting a few cartoons. One page depicts an astronaut\\'s close encounter with a nude woman; another captioned \"Looks Bad, Feels Good\" shows Young on the lunar surface, blocking the view of a TV camera with his hand. Both items sold for $206,000.Not everything was astronomically priced, however, so there were a few bargains to be had. Two lots of charts marking the orbital paths of Apollo 14 over the Earth and moon sold for $112 apiece. A couple of crew emblems from the 1970s space station Skylab sold for the same price. Although most lots went, a few failed to attract any bidders. A dust brush from the personal collection of Fred Haise, who flew on the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission, did not find a buyer. Despite being coated with lunar dust, having been used to clean camera lenses during Apollo 14, no one was prepared to pay the asking price of $125,000?175,000.Some artefacts provide a glimpse into the minds of the men who flew to the moon. Having failed to obtain life insurance for their dangerous mission, Armstrong, Aldrin and Michael Collins signed a set of envelopes featuring the Apollo 11 crew emblem. They hoped that in the event of their demise the envelopes could be sold as a means of financial support for their families.Aldrin offered his own envelopes for sale in the auction, bringing in a total of $15,860.The full catalogue of lots sold in yesterday\\'s Apollo auction at Bonhams can be viewed online (pdf) along with the prices fetched.

As part of the new ?I Scheme? curriculum, which will replace the existing ?G Scheme? curriculum from the upcoming academic year, the state board has introduced a mandatory six-week internship in the last year of the diploma. The students will also receive hands-on training throughout the three-year course by working on ?mini projects?.?The curriculum provides for industry-relevant skills to the students. It will focus more on practical training than theoretical knowledge?, said Vinod Mohitkar, secretary, MSBTE. He added that declining number of students in diploma programmes was one of the considerations while designing the new curriculum.So far, the theory aspect of engineering has been the major component of all diploma programmes. Industry apprenticeship was limited to the institutes offering ?sandwich pattern? programmes, where two semesters of industrial training was sandwiched between classroom teaching. ?I scheme? is an outcome-based curriculum pattern, with specific sets of goals defined for the each programme. It follows a variation of choice-based credit system (CBCS), which allows students to choose from a list of subjects. ?The students can specialise in an area of their choice,? said Mohitkar.The board has also decided to prepare learning resources such as lab manuals and sample question papers, to ensure uniform and effective implementation of the curriculum.Gopakumaran Thampi, principal, Thadomal Shahani College of Engineering, said that the new curriculum has been designed to encourage students to join the industry, instead of opting for higher education. ?Many students treat the diploma as a stepping stone for a degree course. The curriculum will ensure that the students intuitively learn skills required in the industry, rather than seeking knowledge,? he said.HT, on Saturday, reported that, in the last two years, the number of students applying for diploma courses has dipped by 38%, as the students increasingly prefer pursuing degree engineering after junior college or joining a vocational courses at an Industrial Training Institute.Thampi believes that the board will have to do more than just revise the curriculum if it wants more students to join polytechnics. ?The diploma holders are looked down upon in the society. As a result, most of the students opt for degree engineering. The board needs to glamourise and market diploma programmes and explain their importance in nation building,? he said.How ?I Scheme? curriculum was developedMaharashtra State Board of Technical Education (MSBTE) had begun the exercise to revise the curriculum in October 2015, when it convened a meeting of around 60 industry experts in Pune to gauge their expectations from diploma holders, in terms of knowledge skills and attitudes. The National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research (NITTTR), Bhopal was appointed as an education consultant for this project. MSBTE, then, prepared two separate questionnaires to seek inputs from industries and alumni of polytechnics in the state.The feedback from around 300 industries and several alumni were collected, tabulated and analysed, using statistical tools.The requirement of industry were prioritised in terms of various categories of subjects such as basic science, engineering science, engineering technology, core technology and applied technology.Based on this data, the structure of 18 engineering diploma programmes, including mechanical, civil, computer and electrical engineering, were developed. The final drafts were further fine-tuned after running them by industries again.Fewer takers for engineering diplomaThis year, the state?s directorate of technical education (DTE) received around 65,406 applications, 185 less than 80,000 applications received in academic year 2016-17.

The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has also slapped a penalty of Rs 10,000 each on these erring operators besides removing them from its system. \"We have received certain complaints...we have a zero tolerance policy on overcharging.

Removal of these operators from the system implies they would not be able to conduct enrolment for Aadhaar from anywhere in the country. UIDAI is the nodal body responsible for rolling out Aadhaar, the 12-digit unique identification number that identifies residents based on biometrics.

Therefore, clear guidelines of what to bring to the schools is required, it said.The school managements should inform students well in advance about the textbooks and notebooks to be brought to the school on a particular day. The department asked the schools to sensitise parents and students about appropriate kind of school bags to be used.The order also said that there should be no homework for primary school students and all work pertaining to exercises given at the end of each unit or lesson in textbooks should be done during school hours under supervision of teachers. ?The school should plan for homework to classes VI to X by allocating particular days for homework for specific subjects,? the order said.The order also asks schools to provide safe drinking water so as to avoid children getting water bottles from home, which add to their load.The Andhra Pradesh Child Rights Association has welcomed the move and said the government should ensure strict implementation of the order. ?The officials should take action against the school managements which insist on workbooks and other material, thereby overloading the students,? association president P Achyuta Rao said.', 'Prime Minister Narendra Modi today hit back at senior Congress leaders who had questioned the intention and success of the Centre\\'s demonetisation initiative.Speaking at the foundation stone laying ceremony of Mahamana Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre in Varanasi, Narendra Modi took on Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former Finance Minister P Chidambaram for doubting the note ban move.The three leaders have been speaking against the demonetisation step ever since it was announced on November 8. While Rahul has called it a scam, Manmohan sought to aggressively attack Modi on the move, calling it an \"organised loot and legalised plunder\" in his speech in Rajya Sabha in the recently concluded Winter Session of Parliament.

The woman, identified as Sonam, was shot dead at point blank range by her sister Shazia using a country made pistol at their home on December 14. The pistol belonged to the boyfriend of the accused. He used to hide the gun at her house. Both Shazia and Sonam were divorced.On Monday, the northeast district police arrested 21-year-old Shazia and recovered the weapon of offence, even as she tried convincing the police that her sister was killed by her stalker who had been harassing her for the past some months. Police said Shazia cooked up the stalking story to mislead the probe.A senior police officer said that during the questioning, Shazia disclosed the alleged involvement of her boyfriend Waseem. She said that he gave her the idea of killing Sonam. The couple was angry with Sonam as she had threatened to reveal their relationship to their parents. Sonam had also allegedly started showing interest in Waseem. AK Single, deputy commissioner of police (northeast), said that last week, Shazia and Sonam entered into an argument over this. ?Their fight turned into a scuffle during which Shazia took out her boyfriend?s pistol and shot Sonam at point blank range,? Single said. As Sonam collapsed, Shazia rushed out with the pistol and went to the house of her neighbour Abid, who had been introduced to her by Waseem. She left the pistol at Abid?s home and returned.Shazia informed her parents who were out at that time. They returned home and rushed Sonam to a nearby hospital where doctors pronounced her dead on admission. The hospital authorities then called the police. The police took Sonam?s father into custody for questioning as the family had not informed them about the firing. Shazia and other relatives were also questioned. ?She initially tried misleading us with a stalking story which she cooked up to hide her own crime. But as her behaviour was suspicious and there were discrepancies in her statement, we questioned her separately during which she confessed to the crime,? said the officer.Waseem and Abid were absconding after the crime and teams have been formed to nab them. The police want to know why Waseem had kept the pistol at Shazia?s home. ?Whether Waseem has a criminal background can be confirmed only when we arrest and question him. The antecedents of Abid are also being verified,? the officer said.

They said on Monday that they had bought the apartments legally and blamed officials for not checking the rules while approving construction plans.  Some of these structures were built around 50 years ago. Jagdish Desai, secretary, Forum for Improving the Quality of Life in Suburbs, said the move was ill-advised. ?These people have used their life savings to buy these apartments and now they are being told that their houses are illegal. Residents are bearing the brunt of the mistakes authorities committed,? said Desai.The 70 buildings are located in Vile Parle, Ghatkopar and Santacruz. A survey conducted by the Mumbai International Airport Ltd and the Airport Authority of India between 2010 and 2011 identified 137 structures and classified them as obstacles.A resident of one of the affected buildings at Santacruz said most of the residents in these buildings are senior citizens. ?We bought the apartment in 1977 and after 40 years, we are being told that our house will be demolished. Imagine our shock on realising that we soon might not have a roof over our heads,? said the resident, who requested not to be named.

The system invented by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in the US improves visibility by constantly redirecting light to shine between particles of precipitation. It prevents the distracting and sometimes dangerous glare that occurs when headlight beams are reflected by precipitation back toward the driver. \"If youre driving in a thunderstorm, the smart headlights will make it seem like its a drizzle,\" said Srinivasa Narasimhan, CMU associate professor of robotics. The system uses a camera to track the motion of raindrops and snowflakes and then applies a computer algorithm to predict where those particles will be just a few milliseconds later. The light projection system then adjusts to deactivate light beams that would otherwise illuminate the particles in their predicted positions. \"A human eye will not be able to see that flicker of the headlights,\" Narasimhan said. \"And because the precipitation particles arent being illuminated, the driver wont see the rain or snow either,\" To people, rain can appear as elongated streaks that seem to fill the air. To high-speed cameras, however, rain consists of sparsely spaced, discrete drops. That leaves plenty of space between the drops where light can be effectively distributed if the system can respond rapidly. Lab tests demonstrated that the smart headlight system could detect raindrops, predict its movement and adjust a light projector accordingly in 13 milliseconds. At low speeds, such a system could eliminate 70 to 80 per cent of visible rain during a heavy storm, while losing only five or six per cent of the light from the headlamp. To operate at highway speeds and to work effectively in snow and hail, the systems response will need to be reduced to just a few milliseconds. Lab tests have demonstrated the feasibility of the system and the researchers are confident that the speed of the system can be boosted. For instance, the test apparatus couples a camera with an off-the-shelf DLP projector. Road-worthy systems likely would be based on arrays of light-emitting diode (LED) light sources in which individual elements could be turned on or off, depending on the location of raindrops.

India have played the tournament in all the previous seven editions finishing on top twice while ending runners-up once.Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and most lately Shikhar Dhawan have been key to India's rise at the multi-nation tournament. Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and Ishant Sharma have been the among the top wicket-takers at the event while MS Dhoni is the most successful Indian wicket-keeper. This time they will go into the tournament as defending champions and would look to create history by becoming the first team to win the championship thrice.Here's a look at India's journey at the top ICC event:1998 Wills International Cups (Bangladesh) - SEMI-FINALSIndia fielded a strong side with Mohammad Azharuddin as captain. The side boasted of a strong batting line-up with the likes of Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Ajay Jadeja and Robin Singh in the side. Javagal Srinath spearheading the pace attack while Anil Kumble looked after the spin department.However,India were knocked out in semi-finals by West Indies, who were led by Brian Lara.2000 ICC KnockOut (Kenya) - RUNNERS-UPSourav Ganguly's 117 went in vain in the big final as Chris Cairns' 102 not out guided New Zealand to a four-wicket win to hand Kiwis the trophy. Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan made their debuts for India in the tournament.2002 ICC Champions Tropy (Sri Lanka) - CHAMPIONS (Shared)India, under Sourav Ganguly, went a step further by becoming the joint champions with Sri Lanka after the final was rained-off twice. In the final, Sri Lanka posted 244/5 with Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara scoring a fifty each. In reply, India started off well and were 14/0 in two overs when rain halted the proceedings and no further play was possible that day.On the reserve day, Sri Lanka again won the toss and batted first. This time Mahela Jayawardene and Russell Arnold struck fifties to help Sri Lanka post 222/7 in their 50 overs. In response, Virender Sehwag looked at his menacing best with 25 not out off 22 balls when heavy rain stopped play. Once again the persistent rain denied a result and the trophy was awarded to both Sri Lanka and India.2004 ICC Champions Trophy (England) - GROUP STAGEIndia failed to go beyond the group stage. India started off their campaign with a thunderous 98-run win over Kenya but a three-wicket defeat against Pakistan was enough to stop Ganguly's men from advancing to the semi-finals.2006 ICC Champions Trophy (India) - GROUP STAGEIndia's batting line-up failed to fire in the big tournament at home. They managed to beat England in their first game but their star-studded batting continued to misfire and consecutive defeats against West Indies and Australia left them with just one win in the tournament.2009 ICC Champions Trophy (South Africa) - GROUP STAGEIndia again failed to impress. Rahul Dravid-led side started with a 54-run loss against Pakistan while their next game against Australia yielded no result because of rain. In their third group match, India beat West Indies to finish with three points in the table but it was not enough to get them through to the semi-finals.\", 'Controversies are nothing new to Kamal Haasan. Recently, in a press conference, Kamal Haasan, while supporting the Malayalam actress, named the survivor\\'s name and tried to justify it. \"Why is it the safety of women in the film industry alone? A female\\'s presence in the crowd is important to me and I will not let anything happen to her. It\\'s our duty to see if you are safe. It is not just about actresses. We are not supporting her (mentions the name), because she is an actress,\" said Haasan.When a female reporter corrected Haasan and asked him to not name the victim, he said, \"It doesn\\'t matter if I have used the name. It is you (media). You put out her name when the incident happened. Do not hide the name as there is nothing wrong with it. If you want to call her Draupadi, call her that. Don\\'t refer to her as \\'a female\\',\" he added.While Kamal was appreciated for his take on women\\'s safety, he was severely criticised for naming the actress\\' name. Earlier, Malayalam actress Dileep and Aju Varghese received brickbats for the same.

The state has now promised to implement the system gradually to avoid similar problems in the future.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0?It is a serious issue. The MU had recently shifted to an online system for assessment of answer papers, which caused a delay in completing the assessment work. Scenario would have been different if it had been implemented in stages,? chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said. Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Fadnavis was replying to a query raised by Nationalist Congress Party legislator and former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. The NCP leader said the university had failed to meet the July 31 deadline given by the governor Ch Vidysagar Rao for completing assessment work. Of 477 courses offered by the varsity, it declared results for only 173 courses on Monday.Â\\xa0Asking the chief minister to intervene, Pawar said the issue had tarnished the university?s reputation in the country. Further delay in declaring results may also impact students who want to pursue higher education abroad, he added. Fadnavis said the online assessment system is the need of the hour and has been adopted worldwide. ?The system ensures that evaluators assess answer papers online, thus bringing transparency. The government will make sure that the system is implemented smoothly in phases,? he said.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0He also informed the assembly that of 17.50 lakh answer sheets, 14 lakh have been evaluated so far.

', 'The Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) administration, on Thursday, lodged an FIR at University police station against former Delhi law minister Jitendra Singh Tomar , in a case pertaining to obtaining a fake law degree from the university.The FIR was filed about four months after Tomar?s ?fake? degree was cancelled by the university, after receiving approval of the TMBU?s academic council, syndicate and senate.Â\\xa0 TMBU proctor Yogendra, who goes by a single name, is the informant in case.?Documentary evidence emerging from the findings of a probe initiated by the TMBU administration, establishing the  former minister had committed fraud for procuring a fake degree from university, has been attached with petition submitted to police for lodging the FIR?, he said.Â\\xa0 Rajesh Tiwary, TMBU?s OSD (legal),said the findings of enquiry related to university papers and residential address submitted by Tomar at the time of his enrolment in law course at Viswanath Singh Institute of legal studies (Munger), which functions under TMBU, had also be referred to in the FIR.The TMBU officials had no clear answer as to why it took the university nearly four months to initiate legal action against former minister after his degree was cancelled.Â\\xa0In March this year, the TMBU senate had, by a unanimous voice vote, approved the cancellation of the law degree of Tomar, which was earlier found to be ?fake? in an inquiry held by the university in 2016.The finding was conveyed to a Delhi court hearing a case in connection with Tomar?s degree, through an affidavit filed on behalf of TMBU. Subsequently, the process for cancelling the ?tainted? degree had been initiated by the TMBU authorities.The senate approval has paved way for the issuance of a formal notification by university for cancellation of his degree, which had allegedly been issued with the connivance of some employees of the university.Earlier, the examination board and disciplinary committee of the university had given their consent for cancellation of Tomar?s law degree. Even the Delhi police, in its inquiry conducted separately, had found that Tomar?s law degree was fake.Tomar was arrested by the Delhi police on June 9, 2015 in connection with the fake degree case. He had submitted his resignation to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the following day, just hours after a Delhi court remanded him to four-day police custody.More than a dozen university employees, who had been indicted in the probe undertaken by university and also in Delhi police probe, for their complicity in issuing a fake degree to the former Delhi minister have, however, been spared legal action, for now.TMBU?registrar Mohan Mishra said hearing in  the fake degree case was underway in the Delhi high court and the employees indicted in university probe had been also indicted in probe of Delhi Police. ?The TMBU decided to defer initiation of separate legal action against them till the decision of court on employees is known?, he explained.', ' An 18-month-old girl was killed while crossing the road with her mother after a car knocked her down in Santacruz (West) on Saturday.

Traditionally, large scale greenhouse gas emissions data is collected at a national level but this report focuses on fossil fuel producers. Compiled from a database of publicly available emissions figures, it is intended as the first in a series of publications to highlight the role companies and their investors could play in tackling climate change. The report found that more than half of global industrial emissions since 1988 ? the year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established ? can be traced to just 25 corporate and state-owned entities. The scale of historical emissions associated with these fossil fuel producers is large enough to have contributed significantly to climate change, according to the report. ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988. If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next 28 years as they were between 1988 and 2017, says the report, global average temperatures would be on course to rise by 4C by the end of the century. This is likely to have catastrophic consequences including substantial species extinction and global food scarcity risks.While companies have a huge role to play in driving climate change, says Faria, the barrier is the ?absolute tension? between short-term profitability and the urgent need to reduce emissions.A Carbon Tracker study in 2015 found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting more than $2tn over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless in the face of international action on climate change and advances in renewables ? in turn posing substantial threats to investor returns.CDP says its aims with the carbon majors project are both to improve transparency among fossil fuel producers and to help investors understand the emissions associated with their fossil fuel holdings. A fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions are backed by public investment, according to the report. ?That puts a significant responsibility on those investors to engage with carbon majors and urge them to disclose climate risk,? says Faria.Investors should move out of fossil fuels, says Michael Brune, executive director of US environmental organisation the Sierra Club. ?Not only is it morally risky, it?s economically risky. The world is moving away from fossil fuels towards clean energy and is doing so at an accelerated pace. Those left holding investments in fossil fuel companies will find their investments becoming more and more risky over time.?There is a ?growing wave of companies that are acting in the opposite manner to the companies in this report,? says Brune. Nearly 100 companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Ikea have committed to 100% renewable power under the RE100 initiative. Volvo recently announced that all its cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019. And oil and gas companies are also embarking on green investments. Shell set up a renewables arm in 2015 with a $1.7bn investment attached and a spokesperson for Chevron says it?s ?committed to managing its [greenhouse gas] emissions? and is investing in two of the world?s largest carbon dioxide injection projects to capture and store carbon. A BP spokesperson says its ?determined to be part of the solution? for climate change and is ?investing in renewables and low-carbon innovation.? And ExxonMobil, which has faced heavy criticism for its environmental record, has been exploring carbon capture and storage.But for many the sums involved and pace of change are nowhere near enough. A research paper published last year by Paul Stevens, an academic at think tank Chatham House, said international oil companies were no longer fit for purpose and warned these multinationals that they faced a ?nasty, brutish and short? end within the next 10 years if they did not completely change their business models. Investors now have a choice, according to Charlie Kronick, senior programme advisor at Greenpeace UK. ?The future of the oil industry has already been written: the choice is will its decline be managed, returning capital to shareholders to be reinvested in the genuine industries of the future, or will they hold on, hoping not be the last one standing when the music stops??', 'New Delhi The Delhi high court on Tuesday said the ongoing Delhi University admissions could be impacted by the Class 12 examination answer sheets submitted to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for re-evaluation this year.A bench of acting chief justice Gita Mittal and justice C Hari Shankar said ?the merit position of students could change substantially? on the basis of marks obtained after re-evaluation. ?Therefore, as a matter of abundant caution, colleges and admission-seeking students need to be kept informed about the pendency of the writ petition as well as the fact that the process of re-evaluation of marks by the CBSE on the request of some students is underway,? it added.Last week, the court had lifted all conditions imposed by the CBSE on students seeking to re-evaluate their Class XII answer sheets. The verdict came on a plea filed by advocate Sandeep Bajaj, who was representing four students against the board?s notification limiting the scrutiny of marks to just 12 subjects.Nearly 11 lakh students appeared for the Class 12 exams conducted by the CBSE this year, of which 2.47% applied for re-evaluation.However, Delhi University officials said this need not worry students who have already secured college seats. ?Once a student?s admission is approved and they pay the admission fees, it will not be cancelled even if their marks get reduced after re-evaluation. Admissions will be cancelled only if the student provides the university with fabricated certificates and such,? said MK Pandit, chairperson of the admissions committee.Pandit said there are provisions in the university admission guidelines to accommodate students whose grades have increased after re-evaluation. ?The guidelines clearly state that a student who qualifies under a cut-off list but fails to take admission may do so on the last day of admissions under subsequent cut-off lists, subject to the availability of seats,? he added.Pandit said college principals and students are aware of the stipulations, and clarifications have also been issued in this regard.(With inputs from A Mariyam Alavi)', 'Analysing Sri Lanka\\'s recent poor run on foreign shores, former skipper and current chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya on Thursday lamented that in recent times, the country has failed to produce any of the champion cricketers of the past.\"I wouldn\\'t say there\\'s a dearth of talent but we don\\'t produce those champion cricketers as much as we did in the past,\" Jayasuriya was quoted as saying by espncricinfo.\"I don\\'t think it\\'s a problem with the domestic structure or the school structure, because it\\'s the very system that produced all those champion cricketers in the past.

', 'Coming on the heels of the controversy about Indu Sarkar, a top official of the Film and Television Producers Guild of India says such topics have become ?radioactive? nowadays. Speaking at the Word To Screen, Publishers Bootcamp by Jio MAMI here, Guild president Siddharth Roy Kapur said that ?making a biopic on a political figure is radioactive right now?.Later, prodded by IANS to elaborate on the sidelines of the event, Kapur said, ?It?s unfortunately the environment that we are in at this point of time that most filmmakers are self-censoring when it comes to subjects that they pick to make a movie about because they are concerned about how it will finally be received when it goes to the CBFC for clearance. In that process, we might be really losing out on quite a few interesting stories that should be told, and I do hope that the environment changes.?Movies like Lipstick Under My Burkha and Udta Punjab ran foul of the censor board but were cleared after appeals or cuts.Kapur, former head honcho of Studios, Disney UTV, said that former actress Smriti Irani?s appointment as Cabinet Minister for Information and Broadcasting, would bring about a change for the Indian film industry which was constantly battling censorship woes. ?It?s a very positive step because she?s someone who understands the industry. I?m quite certain that we will see an easy and a more liberal view of film certification in the months to come,? Kapur said.?I believe that the (government-appointed) Shyam Benegal Committee has made some very good recommendations on what should be done as far as the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is concerned. I do hope that?s implemented at the earliest,? added Kapur.Given that the $2 billion film industry of India, one of the largest movie-producing nations in the world, was not generating the moolah it should for a multiple of reasons -- lack of screens, slowdown in domestic theatrical revenue, steady growth in Hollywood market share and emergence of digital platforms and quality content -- Kapur sees light at the end of the tunnel.?Every industry goes through cyclical times. The cycle we are going through right now is where the economics are very challenging. Having said that, I?m quite optimistic that since we have a very strong movie-going culture, our own ethos of a star system and our own grammar of storytelling, we will come out of this,? said Kapur.?I think it?s about the industry figuring out an economic model that makes sense to everyone in the value chain rather than for a few people. And once that changes, we will see the industry do much better,? he said, adding how filmmakers need to be ?smart about their films?, release date and strategy.As for Hollywood eating into local films? business, he said, ?It?s happening and it?s definitely something to be concerned about... Because the fact is that they are making movies that are bringing people to cinemas... And that?s what we need to do too.?Exorbitant fee charged by stars can sometimes inflate a film?s budget, but breaking away from the strongly-rooted star system is going to be no answer either, said Kapur. ?I don?t think the star system will break and I don?t think it should. But I think that along with the star system, there needs to be great content that can stand on its own without any star. I have seen so many movies in the recent past that have done this and have done it very effectively,? he said.Kapur has been associated -- as producer, co-producer or associate producer -- with a mix of these -- Dangal, Kai Po Che, The Lunchbox, Raajneeti, Barfi!, Chennai Express, Shahid, Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana, A Wednesday and Paan Singh Tomar. Now he is on a new journey of his own -- that of driving his home banner Roy Kapur Films.?I?m very excited about this next phase of my career where I will be looking at all kinds of content across the board, genre-agnostic, completely. I just want to tell great stories; do some great movies that I can be proud of,? he said.His slate includes an Aamir Khan-starrer biopic on astronaut Rakesh Sharma and a biopic based on the life of a man named Vijendra Singh who had lost his wife Leela in the Uttarakhand floods.Not ready to spill more beans about any of his projects, Kapur said: ?It?s a little early to talk about any of them at this point of time.?', 'New Delhi, Dec 10 (PTI) Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwals following on Twitter today crossed 10 million, further cementing his position as the second most followed Indian politician.

It was deferred in the April meeting and has not been taken up since then. We are not sure whether it will be scrapped totally or reconsidered later,\" NDMC Vice Chairman Karan Singh Tanwar told PTI.In a meeting on April 24, some council members had claimed the proposal had been passed but the civic body chairman, Naresh Kumar, had announced hours later that the issue was deferred.The proposal has not been taken up in any council meeting since then.The prime minister, who is on a three-day visit to the Jewish nation, has visited Haifa to pay homage to Indian soldiers who fought in the World War I.HAIFA DAY - RESPECT FOR SOLDIERSThe Israeli city was liberated from Ottoman occupation by Indian soldiers during the war.A large number of Indian soldiers of the 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade died during the battle to free the city and nearly 900 are buried in Israel.September 23 is celebrated as Haifa Day in India and Israel every year as a mark of respect for the soldiers who lost their lives in the battle and to mark the end of 400 years of Turkish control over the city.Demands to rename Teen Murti Road and Chowk have been made over the past few years by different organisations, including the RSS.Senior RSS functionary Indresh Kumar had said in 2015 that the government should acknowledge the role played by the three regiments of the Indian Army in the Battle of Haifa in 1918.According to the Ministry of Culture, a \"wrong impression\" has been built about the Teen Murti Chowk that it has something to do with Mahatma Gandhi.\"The Teen Murti Chowk was named to mark the role of the three cavalry regiments.

Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan had flagged the low remuneration issue last August saying it makes difficult for state-owned banks to \"attract top talent, especially a lateral entry\". According to annual reports of various banks, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya took home Rs 28.96 lakh last fiscal, which is pittance when compared to remuneration her counterparts in private banks receive. In comparision, ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar received a basic salary of Rs 2.66 crore last fiscal besides Rs 2.2 crore performance bonus. In addition, she received allowances and perquisites of over Rs 2.43 crore. Similarly, Shikha Sharma, MD and CEO of Axis Bank, took home a basic salary of Rs 2.7 crore and Rs 1.35 crore as variable pay, besides host of perk and allowances, like Rs 90 lakh HRA. Yes Bank MD and CEO Rana Kapoor, who also happens to be promoter of the bank, took home Rs 6.8 crore as salary in 2016-17. HDFC Banks Managing Director Aditya Puri saw his remuneration rise marginally to Rs 10 crore and exercised stock options worth over Rs 57 crore during the last fiscal. Speaking about public sector banks at a banking conference in Mumbai, Rajan had said state-owned banks tended to overpay at the bottom but underpay their top executives. He jokingly said he himself was underpaid and the disparity made it harder to attract talent from outside at the top level in public sector banks. On the business front, SBI, after merger with its subsidiary banks, caters to 42.04 crore customers with a market share of 23.07 per cent and 21.16 per cent in deposits and advances, as opposed to 18.05 per cent and 17.02 per cent respectively, before the merger.

', 'A Canadian lobster fisherman who saved dozens of endangered whales after they became tangled in fishing nets has been killed ? moments after a last successful rescue.Joe Howlett, from Campobello Island, New Brunswick, boarded a vessel off the province?s eastern coast on Monday to help rescue a north Atlantic right whale that had become heavily tangled in rope. The rescue was steeped in urgency: in the past month, seven north Atlantic right whales have been found floating lifelessly in the Gulf of St Lawrence, off Canada. With a global population believed to be around 525, the string of deaths suggests that more than 1% of the population has died in recent weeks. Howlett helped free the whale ? only to be struck by the mammal moments later, said Mackie Green of the Campobello Whale Rescue Team. ?They got the whale totally disentangled and then some kind of freak thing happened and the whale made a big flip,? Green, who was not onboard the vessel, told the Canadian Press.Howlett had previously saved some two dozen whales over the past 15 years, making use of his deep knowledge of knots and ropes to set the huge mammals free. Just a few days before his death, Howlett had helped liberate another north Atlantic right whale in the region, cutting away a fishing line caught in its mouth. ?Joe definitely would not want us to stop because of this,? said Green, who joined forces with Howlett to launch the whale rescue in 2002. ?This is something he loved and there?s no better feeling than getting a whale untangled, and I know how good he was feeling after cutting that whale clear.?On Tuesday, the federal fisheries department confirmed that Howlett had been killed while on one of its vessels, describing him as an ?irreplaceable member of the whale rescue community?.In a statement, the department offered its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the father of two. ?Taking part in whale rescue operations requires immense bravery and a passion for the welfare of marine mammals,? it noted. ?There are serious risks involved with any disentanglement attempt. Each situation is unique, and entangled whales can be unpredictable.?Howlett?s death comes amid the unprecedented loss of seven north Atlantic right whales in the past month. A team included marine biologists, federal scientists and pathologists, among others, have been racing to figure out why the whales ? which live along the eastern seaboard of Canada and the US and can reach up to 16 metres (50ft) in length ? are dying in large numbers. Last week, they carried out necropsies on three of the seven whales, hoping to find clues before the carcasses decompose. While their findings are still preliminary and don?t explain why the deaths have seemingly occurred within such a short time frame, they found signs of severe blunt trauma and bruising on two of the whales, suggesting collision with a vessel, while the third had been tangled in fishing gear for weeks.', 'Uttar Pradesh chief minister?s office has banned red-carpet welcomes during visits and asked bureaucrats to ?keep it simple?, days after controversy over officials covering up a muddy road with a red carpet during Yogi Adityanath?s visit.?The CM has desired that no red carpets, special towels or particular sofa be arranged during his visits,? read the orders issued by the CM?s principal secretary SP Goyal.The orders have put the officials in a fix and many say they are unsure about what arrangements are to be made in the absence of clear orders. ?It?s a common practice to make seating arrangements for the VIP arrange bouquets for welcome and refreshments. What are we supposed to do now?? a district magistrate from eastern UP asked when told about the orders from the chief minister?s office. On Saturday, controversy erupted after a mud road leading to the house of a slain CRPF sub-inspector in Hamirpur district?s Majhgawa village was covered up by carpets during the CM?s visit. Sources claimed that CM Yogi Adityanath expressed his displeasure over the administration?s failure to ensure proper roads. Officials said the carpet was laid to provide easy access to the house as rain rendered the road slippery.In addition, a luxurious sofa and a cooler were placed and a red carpet laid inside the room where Adityanath spent about 10 minutes. ?I don?t know much but sofa and carpet were set up for the CM,? Saurabh, the son of the martyr, said.Last month, a storm of criticism was unleashed after the administration made similar arrangements for another visit in Deoria but took back the air conditioner and sofa from the family of another slain soldier after Adityanath left the premises. Many questioned whether the move had insulted the dead personnel?s family.Adityanath reportedly took note of the criticism and conveyed his displeasure of the manner in which the whole episode was handled by local officials. Goyal?s written orders, communicated to all commissioners, district magistrates and district police chiefs, have made a specific mention of the Deoria visit.?In the past, there have been instances like the one during Deoria, when ACs, sofa and carpets have been put up for the CM?s visit and removed afterwards. The CM wasn?t happy at the development. He has warned against a repeat of such incidents,? read Goyal?s orders marked?important?.?He wasn?t aware how the matter was handled. Had he known it, it wouldn?t have happened,? an official of the CM?s secretariat said.

The state unit of BJP is divided into 14 districts for smooth functioning. Each district comprises five assembly constituencies and 20 municipal wards. The district presidents are: Roshan Kansal (Keshav Puram), Arvind Garg (Chandni Chowk), Ajay Mahavaar (Northeast), Pravesh Verma (Navin Shahdara), Lalit Joshi (Mayur Vihar), Santosh Pal (Shahdara), Bharat Bhushan Madaan (Karol Bagh), Anil Sharma (New Delhi), Vedpal Maan (Northwest), Ramesh Khanna (West), Suman Prakash Sharma (Najafgarh), Azad Singh (Mehrauli), and Mithilesh Singh (South Delhi).However, Tiwari denied that the list was influenced by a group of leaders or any individual. ?The BJP?has a lot of capable and diligent workers but only 14 names were to be chosen.

They said: ?All you get is academic textbooks to read. Anyone expecting a hands-on approach would be disappointed. I was offered a few opportunities by other graduate schemes and companies [during the Capita training] but I refused them as I was under the threat of a liability to pay Â£21,000. I thought at the end of it how foolish I was.?Another former trainee said that they had decided to leave after just over a year of working for Capita and had been asked to pay about Â£21,000. After protesting, the trainee ended up without her last month of pay, or about Â£1,200.?I think they knew I was vulnerable as I started as a graduate,? the trainee said. The trainee sought a new job after finding they were being used to ?fill HR gaps? rather than being given roles suitable to her training.Capita said that it now charged Â£13,000 to trainees who wanted to leave before completing their training and two years of work. It said it had previously charged different rates depending on the role involved.A spokesperson said: ?All participants in the training are made fully aware, at numerous times prior to commencing the training, that it is provided free of charge to only those people who successfully complete the course and are engaged by Capita or a Capita client. Those who successfully complete the training but cannot be found a role within 90 days also receive the training free of charge.?Further revelations about the Capita scheme come as it emerges that one of Capita?s rivals, FDM Group, a FTSE-listed company which works with the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, also demands graduates sign up to months of unpaid training in order to secure jobs.The group?s graduate programme includes up to 14 weeks of unpaid training, after which it says 99% of attendees are placed in a job.The company also demands that trainees pay up to Â£20,000 if they leave during the training or the first two years of work.A spokeswoman for FDM said: ?The professional training we provide is a major financial investment in our people and in line with employers who invest in their people, we have clauses in our contracts that look to recoup the cost of training with a cap of Â£20,000 if a person leaves during training or the first two years of consulting. We have a commitment to transparency with all applicants to ensure that they understand the terms clearly. Trainees have 14 days from when they start training to trial the programme and leave with no fees charged.??We have a clear and unwavering commitment for all trainees and employees to be treated and compensated fairly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our employees receive a competitive graduate salary that far exceeds national minimum wage levels.?Individuals undertaking our bespoke training do not engage in any work or provide any services for us or any of our clients until they have successfully completed their training, passed all relevant internal and external examinations and been assessed as ready for the workplace.?', 'Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has described as a must-watch and something that ?shakes one deeply? a video put out by Aam Aadmi Party colleague Kumar Vishwas, who takes a swipe at the his own government over the issue of corruption.Still recovering from the humiliating defeat in the Rajouri Garden bypoll where the ruling party lost to the BJP and was pushed to a distant third, Kejriwal stepped in quickly to contain the damage the video could do in the run-up to the April 23 municipal elections, billed as a test of AAP?s popularity.Reflecting on the state of the nation, Vishwas talks about a host of issues -- from Pakistan, Kashmir to corruption. The video that was put on YouTube two days ago has since been shared widely on social media.All political parties and their leader should keep India first, says 47-year-old Vishwas, who is also a poet.?If you form government in Delhi on an anti-corruption plank and fall silent when some of your own come under scanner, people have the right to question you,? he says.Recently, some AAP leaders have been accused of corruption and nepotism by a panel that looked into a string of decisions taken by the Kejriwal government.The CBI is examining accusations of money laundering against Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain.In his ?India first? message, Vishwas also questions the ?personality cult? and goes on to draw a parallel between Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and Yogi Adityanath.?Whether it is Modi, Rahul, Yogi or Kejriwal...it is about five years, 10 years or 25 years.

', \"Parineeti Chopra is making her comeback of sorts in Bollywood. The 28-year-old actor, who was last seen in 2014 film Kill Dil, is gearing up for the release of her upcoming film Meri Pyaari Bindu. In an interview to India Today, she talks about her film, her break, her love for music and Golmaal 4. It has been almost two and a half years since we saw a Parineeti-starrer film. What did you do during this break? If it was two and a half years long, this question was valid. My break was only ten months - I didn't shoot a film for 10 months. I shot the song (Dishoom), did the Dream Tour and I was shooting ads. So this break that everybody has made a thing about really didn't happen. I know this industry is like 'Three days she is not in news, oh she's done'. But never did anybody write me off. I pride myself for the goodwill I earned for the work I did in the first three years. I could hold on to that great work in the beginning and confidently come back with a film two years later.So did you use those 10 months to reassess your career and bring about a change?That was the plan. You are able to really think about what works for you and what you excel at. Adi (Aditya Chopra) and Maneesh (Sharma) were my third eye through that journey and gave me their opinion. I was also working on my fitness. I really had some health issues and had to see a lot of doctors. Let's talk about the Parineeti 2.0. The old Parineeti got a lot of flak for her appearance. How did you cope with all the criticism?When they were criticising me, they were absolutely right. I'd look at that photo and I know that's not me. I'm a very self-assured person which is what makes me real. I'm not showing off by doing so. I have come from that background and family. I knew when I lose the weight, everybody will say that she looks so good. Now I'm in the best-dressed lists. Don't you think actresses face a stern test? Surely it shouldn't all be about 36-24-36.Today 36-24-36 is not the perfect figure. We need to change that stat I feel. Films are a visual medium. They are inspirational. Even when I watch a film, I feel like I want to wear that skirt, have that hair and have a Raj (in my life). Why are films so big? Because they make you cut off (from the real world). If you are not inspirational, then you cannot be on the larger-than-life celluloid. When you are at that global pedestal, you need to inspire - visually, with you performance, voice and dancing. You need to deliver a beautiful image. Fitness is a part of that. And you have been propagating being fit in this new avatar.I have seen the craziest hip-hop dancers who are size 18. They are fit and flexible, so healthy and glowing; (have the) best hair, nails and skin. Fitness does not equal to (being) thin. You need to be your fittest self. It automatically comes from fat loss. People think 'Oh you just go on a treadmill and you lose weight because you want to wear a bikini.' I have been struggling with my weight for 12 years of my life. I couldn't work for more than four hours. I was very big, a UK size 16. My heart and liver were taking a strain, I have an injured knee because of my weight. People don't think of that.Is your approach to picking roles different from before? I definitely feel more responsible towards entertaining the audience. I want to deliver more entertainment value. I definitely want to do an action film. I just hope that they can write a good action character for a girl and it comes to me. I really wanted to do a comedy and I'm doing Golmaal.You are juggling promoting Meri Pyaari Bindu and shooting Golmaal 4. I miss my boys. They are my gang now. Within two days, I was part of that mad team. They literally invest their time, money and skills in playing pranks on each other. When earlier journalists would ask me do you play pranks on sets, I'd be like No. Now [with Golmaal] you are constantly looking behind your back because anything could happen.Rohit Sir (director Rohit Shetty) keeps his team together. They are a seven of us but really it is a cast is of 19 actors.Were you worried that you would get lost in the crowded ensemble?I'm a lover of Golmaal. When Rohit Sir called, I knew I want to do this film; I'm doing this film. Listening to the script was a formality for me. But of course I had to listen to it. I loved my role. I also wanted to work with Rohit Sir. I'd be a tree in his film.Coming back to Meri Pyaari Bindu. How is Bindu different from other romantic comedy heroines?She is irresponsible, doesn't finish things and leaves relationships. She keeps moving cities and jobs. She is not very stable because she wants to fly like a bird, and explore everything and keep trying. That's what makes her stand out. She is not the demure, stereotypical Bollywood heroine of yesteryear. She is spunky. What I do have in common with her is that she loves music and singing, and is energetic. When she enters the room, everybody has to look at what she is doing. We are seeing the lesser-seen musical side of yours in this film. Maneesh Sharma mentioned how you'd sing in the corridors of YRF office. Yes, I used to walk and sing on the first floor when I was working in the marketing department. I think music is what defines me as a person. I really want to take music more seriously. I want to release many more songs and do live shows.\", 'Hyderabad, Jan 5 (PTI) A top Indian Army official today said the \"discourse\" in Jammu and Kashmir is shifting to \"primacy of Islam over Azadi\" adding to complexities in dealing with sectarian faultlines in the border state. \"...Jammu and Kashmir indeed continues to be a challenge and its being dealt with; its getting a little more complex as slowly the discourse, as indeed the entire thrust, is taking a shift towards a primacy of Islam over Azadi.

In its earlier directive on March 24, the RBI had asked all authorised banks to be open on all days from March 25 to April 1, including Saturday, Sunday and all holidays, to facilitate the governments receipts and payments. The departments concerned of RBI were also to remain open on these days. In its revised instructions issued today, RBI said, \"On reconsideration, it has been decided that these branches need not be opened on April 1, 2017.\" In a letter to the Indian Banks Association, unions AIBEA and AIBOA today said the RBI issued the directive \"very late, causing huge resentment\" among bank employees. \"The RBI is fully aware that March 25 and 26 would be weekly holidays for the banks. But very late on 24th evening, the RBI had flashed their instructions through the press and electronic media,\" said a joint letter written by them. Banks remain closed on April 1 every year for their annual closing of accounts. \"In this connection, it has been represented that opening of bank branches on April 1, 2017, may disrupt annual closing, especially in view of merger of some banks taking effect from that date,\" RBI added further.

They have no problem going through the entire records but I am old. Look at my white beard. After reading all this I feel tired also. So please,\" 65-year-old Chief Justice of India JS Khehar said in the Supreme Court on Friday. The CJI was both upset and angry about the number of frivolous petitions piling up in the apex court, which is already reeling under a backlog of nearly 61,000 cases.Pointing out that he has started imposing heavy costs on such petitioners, he slapped fines of Rs 10 lakh on a Bihar MLA and Rs 1 lakh on a Maharashtra professor in two separate cases.The CJI\\'s remarks came just before the lawyer for the professor said she wanted to withdraw the case, which was filed challenging a circular issued by the Gujarat government. An angry Khehar rebuked the lawyer and allowed her to withdraw the plea but after imposing a Rs 1 lakh fine.BACKLOG\"Why do you now want to go back to Gujarat? Why did not this occur to you when you were preparing the petition?\" he said.When the lawyer pleaded for cancelling the cost, CJI Khehar shot back: \"No. This has to stop and only this way it can stop. For years we have not done it. See if you have a good cause we are with you but not for such petitions which take away judicial time.\"Millions of cases are pending in India\\'s courts, draining litigants of resources and pointing towards an urgent need for more judges and judicial reforms. Khehar\\'s predecessor, TS Thakur, said last year that the country needs to double the number of judges.The CJI imposed a Rs 10 lakh fine on Bihar MLA Ravindra Singh for indulging in frivolous litigation. The legislator from the state\\'s ruling RJD had challenged in the SC a high court order dismissing his petition, which questioned the veracity of a 23-year old newspaper article. SC said the cost needs to be higher as the representative of the people was found indulging in \"unpardonable\" activity of wasting judicial time. When the MLA\\'s lawyer pleaded that the cost be reduced, the CJI said after hearing the plea for leniency what came to his mind was the story of a hostel mate while he was a college student.ADJOURNMENTSRecounting the incident, the CJI said, \"When a fine of Rs 25 was imposed on him in a case of indiscipline, he had said, \\'I belong to a rich family. At least impose a fine of Rs 250.\\' Likewise you also please say I am an MLA, please impose a fine of Rs 1 crore on me and not mere Rs 10 lakh. Come on,\" the CJI told the MLA\\'s lawyer, raising peals of laughter in the packed courtroom.What apparently set the tone for the CJI\\'s angry mood in the morning hours itself was a petition filed by a car mechanic from Madurai. He was challenging \"illegal additional floors\" in a hospital in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.\"Can a car mechanic complain about a hospital? What has he got to do with it? All these are vested interests. If anybody has a good cause we are there to hear it. We are adjourning this matter and in the next hearing if you are not able to prove your bonafides, we will impose costs on you,\" he said.\"How many cases we are going to hear which are nonsense and trash? Daily we are seeing such petitions increasing. This is Supreme Court. Do have some respect for us?,\" Khehar questioned.Within hours after taking charge on January 4, CJI Khehar had made his determination to bring down the backlog in the apex court clear by summarily dismissing long-pending frivolous petitions and refusing adjournments in cases. He had begun the practice of disposing of old petitions in a single sitting without granting any adjournments.', 'Politics over \"pink revolution\" has bounced back with vengeance against the country\\'s flourishing meat industry.BJP president Amit Shah has vowed to shut down all slaughterhouses in the state, the nation\\'s leading producer of buffalo meat, if voted to power.In return, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who is seeking re-election for a second term, has now challenged the Modi government at the centre to issue a blanket ban on meat exports.\"I suggest the PM and the BJP\\'s national president go back to Delhi and put an end to exports of meat. Also, they must end the facilities and subsidies provided to any slaughterhouse with immediate effect,\" said the Samajwadi Party leader in an interview to India Today, cycling along the Gomti riverfront. PINK REVOLUTIONDuring his election campaign in 2014, Narendra Modi attacked the then Congress-led UPA government for spawning a \"pink revolution\" -- a term he used for growing meat exports and state subsidies to abattoirs.\"He (Shah) should ban use of leather and start wearing khadaus (wooden sandals). Is this a business started by the SP?\" Yadav said.According to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Development Authority, the country\\'s exports of animal products stood at Rs 30,137 crores in 2015-16, of which buffalo meat alone accounted for Rs 26,681.56 crore.More than 95 per cent of meat exports come from buffaloes, which do not enjoy the sacred status of cows, whose slaughtering is banned in most of the states.The surge in the trade is primarily attributed to rising demands in international market.\"Any business with growing profit will flourish. I ask them to stop export of meat. Where does the meat go from the slaughterhouses?\" argued Yadav. He insisted animal products were also widely used by drug-making companies, many of them in Gujarat, the home state of Modi and Shah. \"He (the BJP president) must also close pharmaceutical companies in Gujarat,\" challenged Yadav.Data shows Uttar Pradesh accounts for the highest share of 28 per cent of the country\\'s total population of buffaloes.HOME TO SECOND-LARGEST NUMBER OF SLAUGHTERHOUSESAccording to an RTI reply by the Animal Husbandry Department last year, the state is home to the second-largest number of slaughterhouses followed by Maharashtra, where a meat ban in 2015 caused a political storm. Â\\xa0Registered abattoirs number 316 in Maharashtra followed by 285 Uttar Pradesh, the RTI response revealed.India, according to a report by credit-rating agency ICRA last year, is likely to record a 50 percent jump in its exports of buffalo meat to Rs 40,000 crore in the next five years, compared with Rs 26,682 crore in FY16. Since 2008, ICRA noted, the exports in the sector have registered a compounded annual growth rate of 29 percent. Asked the sacred cows were also being allegedly butchered along with other livestock in his state\\'s slaughterhouses, Yadav said stringent laws were already in place to prosecute the offenders.\"We have made laws against cow slaughter and those found guilty are punished,\" he said. His government, Yadav added, would deal with any such complaint without prejudice. \"I ask all of you to give information about which SP leader has occupied land (for slaughterhouses)? Which slaughterhouse is involved in cow slaughter?\" he contended.BJP FAILED IN FULFILLING ACHCHE DIN PROMISEThe Samajwadi Party leader accused Modi\\'s BJP of failure in realising its \"Achche Din\" promise for the voters.People of his state, said the UP chief minister, weren\\'t satisfied with the central government.\"Modi is our prime minister. Obviously, there is a lot of cheering for him and people are happy to see him. UP sent the maximum MPs to the Lok Sabha, but now public here wonder what the (central) government has done for them,\" he said when pointed out the prime minister still retained his charisma on voters.Yadav sought to portray development as a key plank for his government to seek another tenure, citing expressways as an example.\"I would like to say that it is for the first time that a balanced work has been done. ...I\\'ve connected 50 districts through a four-lane highway. It has happened for the first time,\" he insisted.The chief minister downplayed criticism that many roads, other than highways, remained dilapidated across the state, saying most of them were under construction.\"For the time in the state, people of UP are happy about the development work we have done. They wish to give us a second chance because of our developmental work. They have seen work progressing from cities to the villages,\" he said.CENTRE TO BLAME FOR METRO DELAYIn response to the prime minister\\'s stinging assault on the Yadav government over its metro project, the CM attributed the delay to the centre.\"Here, you can see that the Samajwadi Party (government) built the metro within a record time of two years. Let them (the centre) first give us the NoC (no-objection certificate). We\\'ve to give that NoC to the railways. There are security checks and trial runs before final clearance,\" he retorted. \"I\\'m not accusing but the railways have its own procedures and security checks.\"Yadav also sought to project his alliance with Rahul Gandhi\\'s Congress party in Uttar Pradesh as a beginning. \"The future of the alliance of SP-Cong can\\'t be concluded as of now but will begin from UP,\" he remarked. \"Maintaining the balance is our success,\" the SP leader said when asked about the prospects of the tie-up between his cycle and Gandhi\\'s hand symbols.He, however, played down suggestions that he might face a political sabotage from within the SP. \"In politics when there are issues in a party. Such doubts are frequently raised. But in my understanding, this won\\'t impact us a lot,\" Yadav said.Â\\xa0Asked whether he had his father, Mulayam Yadav, on board, the chief minister said: \"Netaji is with us. His blessings are with us. He has been involved in campaign trail as well.\"BEST POLICE-RESPONSE SYSTEM ACROSS STATEOn law-and-order, he rejected PM Modi\\'s accusations of biased policing, saying the state government had developed the \"best\" police-response system across the state.\"The nation\\'s best police response system has been made by SP. The concept of (helpline) UP 100 is such that no one can complain that their call wasn\\'t received. Police will reach the spot and help the needy, get the case registered and take action,\" he said. \"After the UP 100 initiative, no one can dare interfere with governance.\"Yadav also specifically listed out pro-woman programs, which he said benefited hundreds of thousands in the state. \"We started the Samajwadi Pension Yojana with 25-35 lakh women getting benefited. And today, we give pension to 55 lakh women, which is sent directly to their accounts. We have decided to provide Rs 1,000, besides pension, to each financially backward woman. This is a huge initiative.\"In her remarks, the CM\\'s wife, Dimple Yadav, however, described woman safety as a national and not solely a state issue.\"There is problem with regards to women\\'s safety, not only in UP but everywhere. But the point is that the issue is discussed during elections only and put aside later,\" she argued.', \"With no end in sight to the standoff in the Sikkim sector, China on Saturday said there is ?no room? for negotiations to resolve the military face-off and the only solution is the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Donglang or Doklam region.India will face ?embarrassment? if it does not withdraw its border troops to its own side and the situation could get ?worse?,Â\\xa0 the official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on Saturday night.?China has made it clear that there is no room for negotiations on this incident, and India must withdraw its border-crossing troops from Doklam. For China, border line is the bottom line,? the commentary said.The commentary sought to add yet another dimension to the face-off by bringing in the Ladakh region and linking it to Pakistan, China?s ?iron brother? ally. ?India should not regard the existing situation as the same as or even similar to the previous two standoffs in 2013 and 2014 near Ladakh, a disputed area between China, Pakistan and India in southeastern Kashmir. Diplomatic efforts led the troop?s frictions there to a well-arranged end. But this time it is a totally different case,? it added.It is rare for China to call Ladakh a ?disputed? region and make a reference to Kashmir.This is the first time that China has clearly articulated ? through one of its primary official channels - that there is no room for parleys to resolve the weeks-long impasse in Donglang, which is under China?s control but claimed by Bhutan.Until now, the foreign ministry had listed the withdrawal of Indian troops hinted as a precondition for resolving the face-off but had hinted there is an ongoing effort to end it through diplomatic negotiations.Xinhua is an organ of the Chinese government and is affiliated to the State Council, the Communist country?s cabinet.Commentaries published by Xinhua and the People?s Daily, the Communist Party of China (CPC) mouthpiece, are taken to be a reflection of the thoughts of the government and the all-powerful CPC.?India has repeatedly ignored China's call for pulling its border-crossing troops from Doklam area back to its own territory. However, turning a deaf ear to China will but worsen the month-long standoff and put itself further into embarrassment,? the commentary said.It added that India had ?lied? to the world by saying it dispatched troops to Donglang to help its ally Bhutan, whereas ?apparently? Thimphu had extended no invitation to New Delhi to intervene.?New Delhi claimed encroachment of its own territory by China before saying it sent troops to ?protect? its ?ally? Bhutan, a sovereign state which has apparently so far made no such an invitation for the sake of that boundary area,? it said.Bhutan and China don?t have diplomatic ties but have held 24 rounds of talks to resolve a boundary dispute.The commentary, however, described foreign secretary S Jaishankar?s remarks during a recent speech in Singapore as a ?positive? sign.?As an old Chinese saying goes, peace is most precious. It has been noticed that Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar recently has made positive remarks in Singapore, saying that ?India and China should not let differences become disputes?,? it said.?What China would like to see more are corresponding actions taken by India.?China has a will to solve the problem peacefully by diplomatic means, and China also cherishes the peace and serenity in the border areas, but the precondition is that the trespassers of India must withdraw unconditionally.?Â\\xa0\", \"Infosys, the Bangalore-based software trailblazer, created history on March 11 by becoming the first Indian-registered company to list on Nasdaq, one of the two major stock exchanges in the US.Technically, however, Infosys is the second Indian company to list on Nasdaq, since the $30 million (Rs 126 crore) US-registered but wholly Chennai-domiciled Cognizant Technology Solutions listed in June 1998. Now the doors are open and we could expect to see at least 10 Indian information technology (IT), pharmaceutical and telecom companies follow Infosys' example over the next two years. By global standards, however, India's presence on Nasdaq will be modest. Some 80 Israeli companies and a good number of companies from Australia, Argentina and South Africa are also on Nasdaq.Nasdaq itself was launched in 1971. Although the most widely-tracked indicator of stock market health, the Dow, is based on its rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), close to 60 per cent of the total share volume and listed companies in the US is on Nasdaq. It is the popular perception that it is an exchange predominantly for IT companies, since its stars have been names like Microsoft, Intel, Oracle and Netscape.Actually, less than 20 per cent of the listed companies are in the IT industry. The bulk are in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, banking, telecom, electronics, oil, transportation and housing. By and large, Nasdaq is home to new, first-generation, technology-driven companies. Already around 20 IT companies founded by Indian-Americans with a total market capitalisation of around $16 billion - like i2 Technologies, Microchip Technologies and Mastech - are listed on it.It is to Infosys' credit that it has been diligently following American accounting principles for the past few years so as to make its debut on Nasdaq easy. The fact that it is a professionally-owned, one-industry company of relatively new vintage helped. Over 80 per cent of its revenues are generated in North America.But a large majority of established, family-owned Indian companies will have to rework their accounts if they wish to seek listing in the US. The American standards are ruthless. In 1993, Daimler-Benz listed on the NYSE. Its reported profit of $370 million under German rules got converted into a $1 billion loss by American standards.This is not so in India. Second, unlike India, the US requires all deferred taxes to be recorded. Third, unlike the US, India allows excess depreciation and provides a choice to the company on the method to be adopted for calculating the depreciation charge.Fourth, unlike the US, the Indian standard recognises the revaluation of fixed assets. Fifth, US accounting standards require gains or losses from foreign currency transactions to be included in determining net income. There are other differences as well - for example, the US does not allow proposed dividend to be accrued and requires current portion of long-term debt to be shown as current liability.The London-based International Accounting Standards Committee, a private-sector body of which the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India is a member, has been pursuing the cause of core, uniform norms to be adopted around the globe. \", 'Addressing chartered accountants on the foundation day of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) at the Indira Gandhi Stadium in Delhi, PM Modi said there had been a record 45 per cent drop in deposits by Indians in Swiss banks.A day after the GST was rolled out in the Central Hall of Parliament, Modi said that the tax reform would help weed out black money.

According to reports, Kritika Chaudhary, a resident of Bhairavnath SRA society, was allegedly murdered by unknown persons around 3-4 days ago. Kritika Choudhary, a resident of Haridwar, was a struggling actress in the film industry. Kritika had worked in Kangana Ranaut-starrer \\'Rajjo\\'. She had also worked in few Balaji production TV serials.The incident came to light at around 3:45 pm on Monday when Kritika Choudhary\\'s neighbours complained of a foul smell emanating from her flat and informed the police. According to the police, her room was locked from outside. A police officer said, \"We are investigating. The door was locked from outside.\" The Mumbai Police has registered a murder case under section 302 under IPC.Police found her body in a decomposed state and the air-conditioner of the room was on.A police officer said, \"The AC of the room was on so that smell could not come out soon. We believe she was murdered three to four days ago.\" The model\\'s body has been sent for post-mortem. Further details are awaited.

Citing the 1890 convention which fixes the India-China-Bhutan trijunction at Gipmochi, far south of where India and Bhutan do, the Foreign Ministry said the \"illegal trespass of border troops goes against convention and is against basic principles of the UN Charter and international laws\".\"The action taken by India is undoubtedly a betrayal of consistent position held by India,\" said Geng, adding that \"Prime Minister Nehru explicitly recognised the 1890 convention between Tibet and Sikkim\" in a March 22, 1959 letter to then Chinese PM Zhou Enlai.India maintains the 1890 agreement only provides the basis of alignment of the boundary, and that the border needs to be finalised by the Special Representatives in maps and on the ground.NEHRU\\'S LETTER READIn the letter Geng cited, Nehru wrote that \"The boundary of Sikkim, a protectorate of India, with the Tibet Region of China was defined in the Anglo- Chinese Convention 1890 and jointly demarcated on the ground in 1895.\"However, in the same letter, Nehru also mentioned agreements on the boundaries in Ladakh and Arunachal, which China now rejects.In fact, in the very same section of the letter, Nehru mentioned the following two agreements: \"The Ladakh Region of the State of Jammu and Kashmir- A treaty of 1842 between Kashmir on the one hand and the Emperor of China and Lama Guru of Lhasa on the other, mentions the India-China boundary in the Ladakh region. In 1847 the Chinese Government admitted that this boundary was sufficiently and distinctly fixed. The area now claimed by China has always been depicted as part of India on official maps, has been surveyed by Indian officials and even a Chinese map of shows it as Indian territory.\"On the McMahon Line, Nehru wrote: \"The McMahon Line-As you are aware, the so-called McMahon Line runs eastwards from the eastern borders of Bhutan and defines the boundary of China on the one hand and on the India and Burma on the other. Contrary to what has been reported to you, this line was, in fact, drawn at a Tripartite Conference held at Simla in 1913-1914 between the Plenipotentiaries of the Governments of China, Tibet and India. At the time of acceptance of the delineation of this frontier, Lonchen Shatra, the Tibetan Plenipotentiary, in letters exchanged, stated explicitly that he had received orders from Lhasa to agree to the boundary as marked on the map appended to the Convention.\" China, however, does not recognise those two treaties.

It?s not a commercial resupply point. It makes sense there is attention on this from foreign public opinion,? said the paper, which is published by the official People?s Daily, said.However, China?s military development was about protecting its own security, it said. ?It?s not about seeking to control the world.?Djibouti, which is about the size of Wales, is located at the southern entrance to the Red Sea on the route to the Suez Canal.

This means commuters will be able to buy tickets or monthly passes using the Mumbai Metro app. Once they pay using their mobile wallets or e-wallet, a QR code will be generated, said officials. A commuter needs to place his mobile screen close to the gate?s sensor , which will scan the code and enable him to access the platform.Officials said this would be the first mobile-based ticketing system to be implemented on India?s Metros.?Commuters will no longer need to go to a ticket counter or to customer care to get a ticket or a pass.

Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in April this year on charges of espionage. Pakistan alleges that Jadhav is a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) agent and is responsible for fomenting unrest in Balochistan, the troubled Pakistani region where Islamabad has long accused RAW of promoting terrorism.In an interview to Pakistan\\'s ARY News, Musharraf drew parallels between Jadhav and Kasab, who was hanged to death in India for his role in the Mumbai attacks. Musharraf said Kasab was just a \"pawn\" while Jadhav is responsible for getting \"dozens of people\" to carry out terrorist activities. \"Who is a bigger culprit (between Jadhav and Kasab),\" Musharraf rhetorically asked, before saying, \"Obviously it is Jadhav.\" \"I don\\'t even know how many people\\'s deaths Jadhav is responsible for,\" Musharraf added.The former Pakistani army chief also slammed his country for appearing in the International Court of Justice, which this week put a stay on Jadhav\\'s death sentence. \"It was wrong that India went to the ICJ,\" Musharraf said, adding, \"Pakistan should not have gone (to the ICJ\". Issues of espionage and sabotage are Pakistan\\'s internal matters, Musharraf added, saying no one has the authority to advise his country on these issues. He also went on to indicate that world bodies like the United Nations and the International Court of Justice don\\'t have any real power. Directives issued by these world bodies are ignored by some countries, Musharraf said when asked whether Pakistan could have realistically avoided sending a team to the ICJ to defend against India\\'s claim. Musharraf went on to cite the example of the United States executing two German nationals in 1999 despite an ICJ provisional ruling putting a stay on the death penalty awarded to the two. THE KULBHUSHAN JADHAV ISSUE In April this year, Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa confirmed the death sentence handed to Kulbhushan Jadhav, accused of spying.India, which slammed Jadhav\\'s trial as \\'farcical\\', said that Jadhav is not a spy and that he is a former Indian Navy officer-turned businessman who was kidnapped in Iran and taken to Pakistan. Contending that Islamabad had violated the Vienna Convention by not providing New Delhi consular access to Jadhav, India filed a petition at The Hague, Netherlands-based ICJ. This week, the World Court, allowing India\\'s plea, asked Pakistan not to execute Jadhav until the ICJ has had the time to hear the matter in full and arrive at a final verdict.ALSO READ: How Pakistani media reported ICJ stay on Kulbhushan Jadhav\\'s death sentence', 'Washington, Mar 27 (PTI) A 38-year-old woman in the US, who was apprehended twice for allegedly trying to jump the White House fence last week, has been arrested for scaling a fence at the Treasury Building. Marci Anderson Wahl of Everett, Washington, was arrested after an alarm sounded at about 2:15 am yesterday when she scaled a fence at the Treasury Building, next to the White House. Police said Wahl has told them she was there to speak to US President Donald Trump, the CNN reported. She was charged with unlawful entry and contempt of court. Wahl was first arrested on March 21 last week for trying to jump the White House fence. Once in custody, it was determined that Wahl had been issued a \"stay away\" order for the White House complex after the incident. On March 21, officers saw Wahl walking and staring at the White House complex before discovering she had jumped a fence on the south side but got stuck. Officers found her hanging from the inside of the fence by her shoelaces, which were \"caught on top of the fence,\" according to a police report. She was re-arrested on March 24 after officers saw her near Lafayette Park. She was released on her own recognisance after a Saturday court appearance. In the incident, Wahl was charged with contempt of court in violation of a stay away order. She pleaded not guilty last Saturday and was again released on her own recognisance.

In its latest report, the World Bank has said, \"The continued gradual slowdown in China will slightly offset a pickup in the rest of the region led by a rebound among commodity exporters. Growth in China is anticipated to slow to 6.5 percent this year and 6.3 percent in 2018.\" According to the World Bank\\'s latest edition of the Global Economic Prospects, India is the fourth fastest growing economy in the world. China shows a clear sign of slowdown and ranks at number 16 in terms of GDP growth rate.INDIA PICKING UPThe World Bank has pegged India\\'s growth rate at 7.2 for the current year on the back of rising export and increase in government spending. Writing in the June edition of the Global Economic Prospects, the The World Bank analysts said, \"In India, recent data indicate an acceleration in growth, with an easing of cash shortages and a rise in exports. An increase in government spending, including on capital formation, has partially offset soft private investment.\" According to the World Bank, \"India is expected to accelerate to 7.2 per cent in fiscal 2017 (April 1, 2017 - March 31, 2018) and 7.5 per cent in the following fiscal year. Domestic demand is expected to remain strong, supported by policy reforms.\"CHINA SLIPSIn terms of growth rate, India is placed behind smaller economies of Estonia, Uzbekistan and Nepal. On the other hand, China failed to secure a place in the top 15 economies in terms of GDP growth rate. The World Bank said, that though China has shown recovery in exports and the robust consumption pattern has helped it grow at 6.9 per cent in the first quarter, Beijing\\'s slowdown is pulling down the east Asian region. Other countries in the region are showing better growth rates.The World Bank has also expressed concern about exacerbating financial vulnerabilities of China on account of \"elevated domestic debt.\" According to the World Bank, the policy uncertainty in the United States and Europe is likely to impact Chinese growth rate more adversely. The trade, immigration and fiscal policies of the US are under review by the Donald Trump administration. Similarly, the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union carries financial risks that could weigh on heavily on the China\\'s growth prospects. Also read:China flexing muscle?

They cannot live together,\" Makki, who is the brother-in-law of Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed, said at a conference here.Makki said the rulers are weakening Pakistan\\'s ideology for extending hand of friendship with India.\"We will defend Pakistan\\'s ideology and will make nation strong to fight the enemy,\" Maki said.NAWAZ SHARIF RECEIVES IRESharif participated in a function in Karachi to celebrate the Holi festival with the Hindu community.In his message to minorities, Sharif warned against the forced conversion and destruction of worship places of other religions, describing them as \"crime in Islam\".Earlier, cleric Allama Ashraf Jalali, secretary general of Sunni Ittehad Council, said that the Prime Minister had not only blasphemed against Islam but also demeaned the \"ideological foundations\" of Pakistan by participating the function.Issuing a fatwa against Sharif the cleric demanded \"an open apology from the premier for violation of his oath.\"', 'Chinese archaeologists today said that they have recovered more than 10,000 gold and silver items that sank to the bottom of a river in southwestern Sichuan Province over 300 years ago.The items included a large amount of gold, silver and bronze coins and jewellery as well as iron weapons such as swords, knifes and spears, said Gao Dalun, director of Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute.The characters carved in the gold and silver utensils are still clear and the embossed patterns on the jewellery show exquisite craftsmanship, state-run news agency Xinhua quoted archaeologists as saying.The treasure site, located in the intersection of Minjiang river and its branch Jinjiang river, is 50 kms away south of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province.It is believed that in 1646, peasant uprising leader Zhang Xianzhong was defeated in the area by Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) soldiers while attempting to transfer his treasure to the south. About 1,000 boats loaded with money and valuables sank during the skirmish.\"The objects have helped identify the area where the battle was fought and are direct evidence of this historical event,\" said Wang Wei, a Chinese archaeologist.Sichuan launched the exploration project in January when the dry season arrived. Several water pumps were used to drain water away day and night.Hundreds of meters of the river bed appeared after archaeologists dug five meters down, where they found the relics.\"The items are extremely valuable to science, history and art. They are of great significance for research into the political,economic, military and social lives of the Ming Dynasty,\" said Li Boqian, an archaeologist from Peking University.Archaeologists said the excavation will last until April and the team expects to unearth more items. ', 'The Centre is bringing in 14 new categories of physical and mental conditions, under the ambit of the Disability Act, 2016. Under the new notification, scheduled to be issued next month, acid attack survivors will be treated as disabled, a senior official in the social justice and empowerment ministry said.At present, the act provides the disability rights and benefits to seven special categories of people comprising blindness, low-vision, locomotive disability, hearing impairment, mental retardation, mental illness and leprosy.The new conditions will apply to people with cerebral palsy, dwarfism, muscular dystrophy, specific learning disabilities, deafness, autism, spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\\'s disease, haemophilia, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, multiple disabilities (condition of any two disabilities or more) and acid attack survivors.PREVIOUS ACTSMinistry officials said the previous Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 1995 mentions only seven categories with people having 40per cent and above disability getting full benefits. In 2001, disability assessment guidelines were prepared for these categories, but there was no measure to calculate the percentage of disability in a person.\"The ministry therefore formed a committee to review how to assess and measure the exiting as well as the proposed disability percentage in a person and accordingly entitlements would be given to the person,\" the official said.The proposed move has come in from all-round praise from social activists.BENEFITS FOR ACID ATTACK VICTIMSLauding the move, Shaheen Malik of Delhi Commission for Women said: \"Adding acid attack survivors into special categories is one of the best things that this government is doing.\"Now, this will ensure if the disabled do not get a private job, he or she can get government entitlements. Also, after an acid attack, our studies get discontinued due to financial losses, so now we can opt for higher studies too,\" Malik said.As per 2011 census, India has 26,810,557 people under disabled population. Government officials said once the new disability assessment guidelines come, all district medical officers will be advised to follow new norms in issuing the certificate.A ministry official said, \"Classification of a person\\'s disability is being made with the difference of 10 per cent each. The health ministry is soon going to submit its report to the social justice and empowerment ministry and it will be notified soon. Presently, people with 40per cent and above disability are getting full benefits. Till then, existing guidelines have to be followed.\"\"All district medical officers would be trained to calculate percentage of disability and understand the new guidelines. It has been noticed that people misuse their disability for benefits, even if they are not eligible. We are making it more clear and stringent so that people with serious disability (40per cent and above) do not get neglected,\" the official said. The committee which drew the new guidelines worked in collaboration with the Union health ministry on the lines of global norms. This committee also formed sub-committees with experts from AIIMS, NIMHANS, Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia.Also Read', 'From K J M Varma Beijing, Jan 7 (PTI) Chinese Met depatment today warned people in capital Beijing to avoid coming in contact with snow which officials said is \"dirty\" as it has absorbed pollutants which had enveloped the city since the final day of the last year. The Beijing weather forecast bureau said that snow followed by blasts of cold wind will clean up the air this weekend. Snow fell in many parts of Beijing today morning and is expected to last into the night, bringing a bit of relief from the smog that has persisted since the last day of 2016. The city witnessed slight snow but the smog continued to envelope the city. Meteorologist Guo Jianxing, however, warned the public not to get too close to snow. \"Because the snow absorbs pollutants, it is dirty,\" Guo said. \"People should carry umbrellas if they walk outside and quickly brush off any snow that falls on their skin,\" he was quoted as saying by state-run Xinhua news agency. According to the citys air quality surveillance centre, with the exception of northwestern Beijing, the capital remained \"seriously polluted\" as of 1 pm today. The density of PM 2.5 - tiny pollutant - was 178 micrograms per cubic meter. The weather bureau said gusts of wind, a major force to dispel the smog, will start to arrive tomorrow from the north. It said Beijings heavy air pollution will be eased and finally cleared from north to south. At worst, only very light smog will linger in a small portion of the city, it added. The smog has become north Chinas biggest environmental issue in recent years, particularly in winter, when coal-fired heating boilers rev up and the wind weakens. Despite drops in pollution indicators, smog still frequently occurs, the report said. Chen Jining, minister of environmental protection, told media here yesterday that his ministry is evaluating emergency plans of 20 cities including Beijing in dealing with heavy air pollution amid criticism that officials shun putting out high alerts to avoid taking action against erring factories. Chen said that inspections had found some cities failing to take effective measures following alerts, or their measures were impracticable. Though pollution in Beijing exceeded hazardous levels for the past several days, the city has not issued the red alert, the maximum warning which would warrant enforcement of odd and even number car system, closure of schools and factories emitting pollution as construction sites.

The order was given to Sidh Sales Syndicate at the value of Rs 35.38 lakh in 2013, the FIR stated.The order was further increased to six bearings at the cost of Rs 53.07 lakh on August 27, 2014.The company supplied two bearings each on three occasions between April 7, 2014 and August 12, 2014.The company submitted certificates in origin showing the bearings were procured from CRB Antriebstechnik, Germany. They were also embossed with the label, CRB-Made in Germany.GCF tests showed that the bearings were unacceptable due to deviations in dimensions.The company provided clarifications and assured that in case of non performance of the bearing due to manufacturing defects, they would replace the bearing free of cost and take corrective action for future supply.\"Consequently the bearings were accepted as a special case by unknown officials of GCF Jabalpur,\" the CBI alleged.Information received by the CBI shows that the German company does not manufacture these parts.It showed that Sidh Sales Syndicate got the six bearings manufactured by Sino United Industries (Luyang) Ltd Henan, China.', 'The luxury shoe and bag retailer Jimmy Choo has put itself up for sale in a move that took the market by surprise.The retailer said it had ?decided to conduct a review of the various strategic options open to the company to maximise value for its shareholders? and that it was seeking offers for the business.The move was backed by the company?s independent directors and JAB Luxury, its majority shareholder with a stake of 68%.Shares in Jimmy Choo jumped 10% to a record high of 186.25p on the news, valuing the group at more than Â£720m. The company floated on the stock market in 2014 at a price of 140p a share, valuing it at about Â£550m.Any sale is expected to attract interest from strategic American buyers as well as Middle Eastern, Chinese and Russian bidders.The company was founded in London in 1996 by the Malaysian fashion designer Jimmy Choo and the then Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon. It runs 150 stores around the world, opening 10 last year as well as refitting 16 shops.It recently reported operating profits of Â£42.5m for 2016, up nearly 43%, after success with luxury trainers. Men?s shoes remain its fastest-growing category and account for 9% of revenue.The company has benefited from the drop in sterling since the EU referendum and is expanding in China. It has fared better than other luxury retailers such as Burberry, which were hit by Chinese tourists cutting back on luxury purchases.JAB, an investment company owned by Germany?s billionaire Reimann family, wants to sell its stake in the shoes group to focus on food and other consumer goods. The family, one of Europe?s wealthiest business dynasties, has been building an empire of coffee brands and last year added Krispy Kreme Doughnuts to its portfolio. It also owns the US cosmetics brand Coty. Luxury investments make up less than 10% of JAB?s portfolio, and it plans to use the sale proceeds to take on the likes of NestlÃ©.A Euromonitor analyst said: ?Globally, retail sales of men?s designer footwear have grown marginally faster than women?s designer footwear over the last three years. So it is easy to see why Jimmy Choo has expanded into this male segment. Women?s luxury footwear still generates almost twice the retail value of men?s luxury footwear, though, and that disparity is unlikely to narrow significantly over the next decade.?But Jimmy Choo needs to be careful not to get ahead of itself. Remember what happened to Mulberry, another niche British luxury brand, when it drifted too far from its comfort zone?

Khehar ji,Excellencies,Honourable Members of Parliament,Ladies and Gentlemen, andFellow CitizensI thank you for electing me to the responsibility of the President of India, and I enter this office with all humility. Coming here to Central Hall has brought back so many memories. I have been a Member of Parliament and here, in this very Central Hall, have had discussions with many of you. Often we agreed, sometimes we disagreed. But we learnt to respect each other. And that is the beauty of democracy.I grew up in a mud house, in a small village. My journey has been a long one, and yet this journey is hardly mine alone. It is so telling of our nation and our society also. For all its problems, it follows that basic mantra given to us in the Preamble to the Constitution - of ensuring Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity and I will always continue to follow this basic mantra.I bow to the 125 crore citizens of this great nation and promise to stay true to the trust they have bestowed on me. I am conscious I am following in the footsteps of stalwarts such as Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, and my immediate predecessor, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, whom we address out of affection as Pranab Da.Our Independence was the result of efforts by thousands of patriotic freedom fighters led by Mahatma Gandhi. Later, Sardar Patel integrated our nation. Principal architect of our Constitution Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar instilled in us the value of human dignity and of the republican ethic.These leaders did not believe that simply political freedom was enough. For them, it was crucial to also achieve economic and social freedom for millions of our people.We would be completing 70 years of our Independence soon. We are also well into the second decade of the 21st century, a century that so many of us intuitively believe will be an Indian century, guided and shaped by India and its accomplishments. We need to build an India that is an economic leader as well as a moral exemplar. For us, those two touchstones can never be separate. They are and must forever be linked.The key to India\\'s success is its diversity. Our diversity is the core that makes us so unique. In this land we find a mix of states and regions, religions, languages, cultures, lifestyles and much more. We are so different and yet so similar and united.The India of the 21st century will be one that is in conformity with our ancient values as well as compliant with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. There is no dichotomy there, no question of choice. We must combine tradition and technology, the wisdom of an age-old Bharat and the science of a contemporary India.As the gram panchayat must determine our consultative and community based problem solving, the Digital Republic must help us leapfrog developmental milestones. These are the twin pillars of our national endeavour.Nations are not built by governments alone. The government can at best be a facilitator, and a trigger for society\\'s innate entrepreneurial and creative instincts. Nation building requires national pride:- We take pride in the soil and water of India;- We take pride in the diversity, religious harmony and inclusive ethos of India;- We take pride in the culture, heritage and spirituality of India;- We take pride in our fellow citizens;- We take pride in our work; and- We take pride in the little things we do every day.Each citizen of India is a nation builder. Each one of us is a custodian of India\\'s well-being and of the legacy that we will pass on to coming generations.- The armed forces that protect our borders and keep us safe are nation builders.- Those police and paramilitary forces that fight terrorism and crime are nation builders.- That farmer toiling in the blazing sun to feed fellow citizens is a nation builder. And we must never forget that so much of our farm labour comprisesÂ\\xa0 women.- That scientist concentrating tirelessly and 24 x 7 to send an Indian space mission to Mars, or invent a vaccine, is a nation builder.- That nurse or doctor helping the sick to recover and fighting disease in a remote village, is a nation builder.- That young person who founds a start-up and becomes a job creator is a nation builder. The start-up could be on a small farm, converting mangoes to pickles. Or in an artisans\\' village, weaving carpets. Or at a laboratory lit up by giant screens.- That tribal and ordinary citizen striving to preserve our ecology, our forests, our wildlife, to push back climate change and to advance the cause of renewable energy, is a nation builder.- That committed and driven public servant who works beyond the call of duty, whether on a flooded road, directing traffic; or in a quiet room, poring over detailed files, is a nation builder.- That self-less teacher who equips young children and shapes their destinies, is a nation builder.- Those countless women who take care of families with so many other responsibilities, at home and work, and raise children to become ideal citizens, are nation builders.People elect their representatives from the Gram Panchayat to Parliament. They vest their will and hopes in these representatives. In turn, the people\\'s representatives devote their lives to the service of nation.But, our endeavours are not for ourselves alone. Down the ages, India has believed in the philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - the World is My Family. It is appropriate that the land of Lord Buddha should lead the world in its search for peace, tranquility and ecological balance.India\\'s voice counts in today\\'s world. The entire planet is drawn to Indian culture and soft power. The global community looks to us for solutions to international problems - whether terrorism, money laundering or climate change. In a globalised world, our responsibilities are also global.This links us to our global family, our friends and partners abroad, and our diaspora, that contributes in so many ways across the world. It brings us to the support of other nations, whether by extending the umbrella of the International Solar Alliance or being first respondents following natural disasters.We have achieved a lot as a nation, but the effort to do more, to do better and to do faster should be relentless. This is especially so as we approach the 75th Year of our independence in 2022. What must also bother us is our ability to enhance access and opportunity for the last person and the last girl-child from an under-privileged family if I may put it so, in the last house in the last village. This must include a quick and affordable justice delivery system in all judicial forums.The citizens of this country are the real source of strength to me.I am confident that they will continue to give me the energy to serve the nation.We need to sculpt a robust, high growth economy, an educated, ethical and shared community, and an egalitarian society, as envisioned by Mahatma Gandhi and Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji. These are integral to our sense of humanism. This is the India of our dreams, an India that will provide equality of opportunities. This will be the India of the 21st century.Thank you very much!Jai HindVande Mataram\" Also Read:Ram Nath Kovind sworn in as India\\'s 14th President; accept role with humility, he saysAll you need to know about Ram Nath Kovind, 14th President of India15 initiatives President Pranab Mukherjee will always be remembered forRam Nath Kovind set to enter Rashtrapati Bhavan: All about 340-room Raisina Hill palaceBJP\\'s presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind: An ardent dog lover', 'Over the years, speculations over Rajinikanth\\'s entry into politics is a news that never sleeps.

The chemicals, extracted from two plants, thunder god vine and aloe, are effective at low doses and have no adverse effect on egg or sperm, other than preventing a key step in fertilisation - the meeting of egg and sperm. They work by stopping sperms power kick, which is normally stimulated by the hormone progesterone secreted by cells surrounding the egg and makes the sperms tail whip forcefully to propel it toward and into the egg. According to researchers from the University of California (UC) Berkeley in the US, the chemicals may serve as an emergency contraceptive taken either before or after intercourse, or as a permanent contraceptive via a skin patch or vaginal ring. Human sperm take about five to six hours to mature once they enter the female reproductive system, which is enough time for the drug to enter the system and block the kick. Also, because the chemicals prevent fertilisation, they may be a more acceptable alternative in the eyes of those who object to emergency contraceptives that prevent the implantation of a potentially viable fertilised egg. These two plant compounds block fertilisation at very low concentrations - about 10 times lower than levels of levonorgestrel in emergency contraceptives, said Polina Lishko, an assistant professor at UC Berkeley. \"They could be a new generation of emergency contraceptive we nicknamed molecular condoms,\" said Lishko, who led the team that discovered the anti-fertility properties of the two chemicals. \"If one can use a plant-derived, non-toxic, non-hormonal compound in lesser concentration to prevent fertilisation in the first place, it could potentially be a better option,\" she said. Purusing books on natural contraceptives used by indigenous peoples around the world, researchers came across several non-steroid chemicals isolated from anti-fertility plants. One of these was pristimerin, from the plant Tripterygium wilfordii, also known as \"thunder god vine.\" Leaves from the plant have been used as an antifertility drug in Chinese traditional medicine, though some compounds in the leaves are poisonous. It has also been used as a folk remedy for rheumatoid arthritis. The other chemical was lupeol, which is found in plants such as mango and dandelion root. While it has been tested as an anticancer agent, it was not suspected of having contraceptive properties.

The objects in which the water is being carried have to keep moving until it reaches the destination, according to the beliefs.The Kanwarias alleged that three youths allegedly hit them with an intention to create trouble and escaped soon after the incident. Although the police maintained that it was a minor accident, they said that however, they are probing the matter to know the antecedents of the youths on the bike and also if there was any other angle to the matter. A case against unidentified persons might be filed for setting the bike on fire, police said. The incident happened when a procession comprising 16 men from Tauru town in Mewat reached the Tikona Park, where the locals alleged that three youths on a bike hit the Kanwarias with a stick and also punched them.?Three or four Kanwarias were injured, but they tried to protect the Dak Mahakanwar. In the melee, the miscreants escaped. Pilgrims and locals tried to chase them. The motorcycle fell at Agarsen Chowk, but the youths managed to escape,? said Anil Mendiratta, a Tauru resident, who has beeing undertaking the procession from Tauru for several years.Kanwarias often get agitated when their way is blocked and it often leads to skirmishes.Tauru resident Gaurav Gauba, who was pushing the Kanwar, said that unidentified youths on bike tried to force their way among the Kanwarias, and one among them punched him. On this, his associate Manoj pushed the bikers. The bikers fled when the people tried to attack them. Soon after the incident, the locals and the pilgrims congregated and shouted slogans against the administration for failing to protect their procession from interruptions and taking action against the interruptors. As per information, the Mahadak Kanwar had left Haridwar on July 16 and was scheduled to reach Tauru on Thursday. The Kanwar entered Sohna town from Chungi No 1 around 1 pm and it took almost an hour to pass through the main Sohna Bazaar as people paid their obeisance. Meanwhile, the police said that as soon as they received the message on the skirmish, they rushed to the spot and managed to pacify the crowd.?Prima facie, it appears to be a minor accident. But we are probing the matter from all angles. Security is being provided to all the Kanwars passing through the town and the situation is under control,? said Brahm Singh, assistant commissioner of police, Sohna.

Enforcement agencies have discovered that now the big monitor lizard (genus Varanus) - found across deserts, forests and coastlines of the country - is being poached for its hemipenis (sexual organ), which is sold as a lucky charm for virility and fertility in men. Because of its forked appearance, it is called \"hatha jodi\". This is often used to confuse customers with the popular Ayurvedic plant \"hath jod\", which serves to mend bone fractures. The Madhya Pradesh special task Force (MPSTF) seized 68 pieces of the tiny reptile body part from four poachers in raids in Indore and Khargone from June 16-17. One of those arrested was a priest of the famous Navagraha temple of Khargone, who was found in possession of 13 hatha jodi. \"This also points towards the artificially created religious beliefs around hatha jodi,\" said RP Singh, additional principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) of MP. Many pieces have been found smeared with vermillion around temples in the past few days. Three traders - Sumit Sharma, Sachin Sharma and Feroze Ali - were nabbed from Indore with 10 pieces of the contraband. Lokesh Jagirdar, the Navagraha temple priest, was also arrested on June 16. On Saturday, following clues given by them, their supplier, Rajesh Porwal, was taken into custody from Indore. Officers said the items were most probably procured from western MP or the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, where the stony and desert topography harbours large populations of the lizard. Each piece was being sold for anywhere between Rs 500 to Rs 15,000 depending on how naive or desperate the buyer is. \"So many false pretexts are given, ranging from boosted sex life to success in lucky draws and gambling and prosperity in business. Unfortunately, with increasing prosperity in towns like Ujjain, Indore and Ratlam, people are willing to shell out the money as well,\" Singh said.SEX SELLS AND SO DO GENITALSDr Sumit Dookia, herpetologist and professor at Delhi\\'s Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, said, \"India has four varieties of these reptiles - Bengal, Yellow, Desert and Water Monitor Lizard. Their habitat is distributed across the middle Himalayas to Western Ghats. They are expert terrestrial animals as well as great swimmers.\" \"Notably, they serve an important role in the ecosystem as scavengers, eating up the flesh of dead animals alongside eggs, insects, small birds and animals. Any downfall in their numbers is unhealthy for the ecosystem,\" he added. They are a Schedule 1 species as per India\\'s Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) prohibits trade in the Bengal Monitor Lizard. Additional Director of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Tilottama Verma, informed, \"Previously, we had found 210 hatha jodis in Brahmeswarpatna area of Odisha on May 30. And 22 such pieces were confiscated in Hyderabad in March, taking the confirmed number of big lizards killed for their genitals to 300 at least. Some such items were seized in Chennai too.\" \"We have long known monitor lizards to be killed sporadically for their meat, fat and oil, consumed in mostly some tribal areas. But hatha jodis certainly came as a surprise to us. We sent them to various scientific labs to ascertain their true origin,\" he added.
